> * [Custom policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md#custom-policies) are designed primarily for identity pros who need to address complex scenarios. For most scenarios, we recommend Azure Active Directory B2C [built-in policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md) because they facilitate easier configuration. The two configuration approaches (built-in and custom) can coexist in the same Azure Active Directory B2C tenant. To learn more, see the [overview of custom policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md).
