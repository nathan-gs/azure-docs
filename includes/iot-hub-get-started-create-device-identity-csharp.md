## Create a device identity
In this section, you create a .NET console app that creates a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry. For more information, see the "Identity registry" section of the [IoT Hub developer guide][lnk-devguide-identity]. When you run this console app, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can use to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub. Device IDs are case sensitive.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to a new solution by using the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template. Make sure the .NET Framework version is 4.5.1 or later. Name the project **CreateDeviceIdentity** and name the solution **IoTHubGetStarted**.
   
    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][10]
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **CreateDeviceIdentity** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.
3. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse**, search for **microsoft.azure.devices**, select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK][lnk-nuget-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.
   
    ![NuGet Package Manager window][11]
4. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Common.Exceptions;
5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub that you created in the previous section.
   
        static RegistryManager registryManager;
        static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
6. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        private static async Task AddDeviceAsync()
        {
            string deviceId = "myFirstDevice";
            Device device;
            try
            {
                device = await registryManager.AddDeviceAsync(new Device(deviceId));
            }
            catch (DeviceAlreadyExistsException)
            {
                device = await registryManager.GetDeviceAsync(deviceId);
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Generated device key: {0}", device.Authentication.SymmetricKey.PrimaryKey);
        }
   
    This method creates a device identity with ID **myFirstDevice**. (If that device ID already exists in the identity registry, the code simply retrieves the existing device information.) The app then displays the primary key for that identity. You use this key in the simulated device app to connect to your IoT hub.
7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        AddDeviceAsync().Wait();
        Console.ReadLine();
8. Run this application, and make a note of the device key.

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the IoT hub. It stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials, and an enabled/disabled flag that you can use to disable access for an individual device. If your application needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an application-specific store. For more information, see [IoT Hub developer guide][lnk-devguide-identity].
