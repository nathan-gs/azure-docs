The virtual network gateway uses specific subnet called the 'GatewaySubnet'. The gateway subnet contains the IP addresses that are used by the VPN gateway services. When you create a gateway subnet, it must be named 'GatewaySubnet'.  Naming a subnet 'GatewaySubnet' tells Azure where to create the gateway services. If you name the subnet something else, your VPN gateway configuration will fail.

The IP addresses in the GatewaySubnet are allocated to the gateway services. When you create the GatewaySubnet, you specify the number of IP addresses that the subnet contains. The size of the GatewaySubnet that you specify depends on the VPN gateway configuration that you want to create. While it is possible to create a GatewaySubnet as small as /29, we recommend that you create a larger subnet that includes more addresses by selecting /27 or /28. Using a larger gateway subnet allows for enough IP addresses to accommodate possible future configurations.
