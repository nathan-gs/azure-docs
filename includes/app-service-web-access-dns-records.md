### Access DNS records with domain provider

First, sign in to the website of your domain provider.

Find the page for managing DNS records. Every domain provider has its own DNS records interface, so you should consult your provider's documentation. Look for links or areas of the site labeled **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.

Often, you can find the link by viewing your account information, and then looking for a link such as **My domains**. Then look for a link that lets you manage DNS records. This link might be named **Zone file**, **DNS Records**, or **Advanced configuration**.

The following screenshot is an example of a DNS records page:

In the example screenshot, you click **Add** to create a record. Some providers have different links to add different record types. Again, consult your provider's documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> For certain providers, such as GoDaddy, changes to DNS records don't become effective until you click a separate **Save Changes** link.
