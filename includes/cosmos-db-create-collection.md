    Setting|Suggested value|Description
    ---|---|---
    Database id|Items|The ID for your new database. Database names must contain from 1 through 255 characters, and they cannot contain /, \\, #, ?, or a trailing space.
    Collection id|ToDoList|The ID for your new collection. Collection names have the same character requirements as database IDs.
    Storage capacity| Fixed (10 GB)|Use the default value. This is the storage capacity of the database.
    Throughput|400 RU|Use the default value. If you want to reduce latency, you can scale up the throughput later.
    Partition key|/userid|A partition key that distributes data evenly to each partition. Selecting the correct partition key is important in creating a performant collection. To learn more, see [Designing for partitioning](../articles/cosmos-db/partition-data.md#designing-for-partitioning).
