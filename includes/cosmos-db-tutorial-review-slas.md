Now that your app is up and running, you'll want to ensure business continuity and watch user access to ensure high availability. You can use the Azure portal to review the availability, latency, throughput, and consistency of your collection. 

Each graph that's associated with the [Azure Cosmos DB Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/documentdb/) provides a line that shows the quota required to meet the SLA and your actual usage, giving you a clear view into your database performance. Additional metrics, such as storage usage and number of requests per minute, are also included in the portal.

* In the Azure portal, in the left pane, under **Monitoring**, click **Metrics**.
