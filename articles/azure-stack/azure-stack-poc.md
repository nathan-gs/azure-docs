# What is Azure Stack Technical Preview 3?
>[!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/What-is-Microsoft-Azure-Stack/player]


Microsoft Azure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your organizationâ€™s datacenter. Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview 3 is being made available as a Proof of Concept (POC). Once deployed, the POC is an ideal environment for learning and demonstrating Azure Stack features. It lets you deploy all required components on a single physical machine to create an environment for evaluating key concepts and capabilities, and validating the extensibility model for APIs.

## Scope of Azure Stack POC
* Azure Stack POC must not be used as a production environment and should only be used for testing, evaluation, and demonstration.  
* Your deployment of Azure Stack is associated with a single identity provider, like Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services. You can create multiple users in this directory and assign subscriptions to each user.
* With all components deployed on the single machine, there are limited physical resources available for tenant resources. This configuration is not intended for scale or performance evaluation.
* Networking scenarios are limited due to the single host/NIC requirement.
