# Subscribe to an offer
Now that you've [created an offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md), test that your tenants can create a subscription.

1. On the Azure Stack POC computer, log in to `https://portal.local.azurestack.external` as [a tenant](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md) and click **Get a Subscription**.

3. To view the subscription you created, click **More services**, click **Subscriptions**, then click your new subscription.  

After you subscribe to an offer, refresh the portal to see which services are part of the new subscription.

# Subscribe to an add-on plan
If the offer has an add-on plan, tenants can add them to their subscription at any time.  

1. In the tenant portal, select More services > Subscriptions .

2. Click on the subscription > Add Plan button, and select the add-on plan.
