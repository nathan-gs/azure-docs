# Use SQL databases on Azure Stack

> [!NOTE]
> The following information only applies to Azure Stack TP3 Refresh deployments. The resource provider will not install on previous test builds.
>
>

Use the SQL Server resource provider adapter to expose SQL databases as a service of Azure Stack. After you install the resource provider and connect it to one or more SQL Server instances, you and your users can create databases for cloud-native apps, websites that are based on SQL, and workloads that are based on SQL without having to provision a virtual machine (VM) that hosts SQL Server each time.

The resource provider does not support all the database management capabilities of [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/). For example, elastic database pools and the ability to scale database performance aren't supported.


## SQL Server resource provider adapter architecture
The resource provider is not based on, nor does it offer all the database management capabilities of Azure SQL Database. For example, elastic database pools and the ability to dial database performance up and down automatically aren't available. However, the resource provider does support similar create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.

The resource provider is made up of three components:

- **The SQL resource provider adapter VM**, which encompasses the resource provider process and the servers that host a small SQL Server used for RP state and as a sample Hosting Server.
- **The resource provider itself**, which processes provisioning requests and exposes database resources.
- **Servers that host SQL Server**, which provide capacity for databases, called Hosting Servers


### Deploy without internet access

To deploy the SQL provider on a system that does not have internet access, you can copy the file [SQL 2014 SP1 Enterprise Evaluation ISO](http://care.dlservice.microsoft.com/dl/download/2/F/8/2F8F7165-BB21-4D1E-B5D8-3BD3CE73C77D/SQLServer2014SP1-FullSlipstream-x64-ENU.iso) to a local file share and provide that share name when prompted (see below). You will also need to provision the Windows Server 2016 VM image and install the PowerShell module using the offline procedure.

> [!NOTE]
> The deployment script performs retries, if necessary, to accommodate less reliable network connections or if an operation exceeds a timeout.
>
>

## Deploy the resource provider

1. If you have not already done so, create a [Windows Server 2016 image with the .NET 3.5 runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-add-default-image) installed.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The current RP uses SQL Server 2014 SP1, which requires the .NET 3.5 runtime - if your image does not contain this optional component, the deployment fails.
  >
  >

2. Sign in to the POC host, [download the SQL Server RP installer executable file](https://aka.ms/azurestacksqlrptp3), and extract the files to a temporary directory. If your POC host has limited hard disk space, you can instead download the executable to another computer and then copy the extracted files to the POC host.

3. Open a **new** elevated PowerShell console and change to the directory where you extracted the files. Use a new window to avoid problems that may arise from incorrect PowerShell modules already loaded on the system.

4. If you have installed any versions of the AzureRm or AzureStack PowerShell modules other than 1.2.9, you will need to remove them or the install will not proceed. This includes later versions.

5. Run the DeploySqlProvider.ps1 script with the parameters listed below.

The script performs these steps:

* If necessary, download a compatible version of Azure PowerShell (only AzureRm version 1.2.9 is supported).
* Create a wildcard certificate to secure communication between the resource provider and Azure Resource Manager.
* Download an evaluation build of SQL Server SP1 from the internet or from a local file share.
* Upload the certificate and all other artifacts to a storage account on your Azure Stack.
* Publish gallery package so that you can deploy SQL database through the gallery.
* Deploy a VM using the Windows Server image create in step 1.
* Register a local DNS record that maps to your resource provider VM.
* Register your resource provider with the local Azure Resource Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> If the installation takes more than 90 minutes, it may fail and you see a failure message on the screen and in the log file, but the deployment is retried from the failing step. Systems that do not meet the recommended memory and core specifications may not be able to deploy the SQL RP.
>

Here's an example you can run from the PowerShell prompt (but change the account information and portal endpoints as needed):

```
# Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module
Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper -Force

# Installs and imports the API Version Profile required by Azure Stack into the current PowerShell session.
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile

Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.9 -Force

# Download the Azure Stack Tools from GitHub and set the environment
cd c:\
Invoke-Webrequest https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip
Expand-Archive master.zip -DestinationPath . -Force

Import-Module C:\AzureStack-Tools-master\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
Add-AzureStackAzureRmEnvironment -Name AzureStackAdmin -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external" 

# For AAD, use the following
$tenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID -AADTenantName "<your directory name>" -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin

# For ADFS, replace the previous line with
# $tenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID -ADFS -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin

$vmLocalAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force
$vmLocalAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("sqlrpadmin", $vmLocalAdminPass)

$AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force
$AdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("admin@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com", $AdminPass)

# Change directory to the folder where you extracted the installation files
<extracted file directory>\DeploySQLProvider.ps1 -DirectoryTenantID $tenantID -AzCredential $AdminCreds -VMLocalCredential $vmLocalAdminCreds -ResourceGroupName "SqlRPRG" -VmName "SqlVM" -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external" -TenantArmEndpoint "https://management.local.azurestack.external"
 ```

### DeploySqlProvider.ps1 Parameters
You can specify these parameters in the command line. If you do not, or any parameter validation fails, you are prompted to provide the required ones.

| Parameter Name | Description | Comment or Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DirectoryTenantID** | The Azure or ADFS Directory ID (guid). | _required_ |
| **AzCredential** | Provide the credentials for the Azure Stack Service Admin account. You must use the same credentials as you used for deploying Azure Stack). | _required_ |

| **Uninstall** | Remove the resource provider and all associated resources (see notes below) | No |
| **DebugMode** | Prevents automatic cleanup on failure | No |


## Verify the deployment using the Azure Stack Portal

> [!NOTE]
>  After the installation script completes, you will need to refresh the portal to see the admin blade.


1. On the Console VM desktop, click **Microsoft Azure Stack Portal** and sign in to the portal as the service administrator.

2. Verify that the deployment succeeded. Click **Resource Groups** &gt; click the resource group you used and then make sure that the essentials part of the blade (upper half) reads **_date_ (Succeeded)**.

      ![Verify Deployment of the SQL RP](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/5.png)

3. Verify that the registration succeeded. Click **Resource providers**, and then look for **SQLAdapter**:

      ![Verify the SQL RP was registered](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/6.png)


## Provide capacity by connecting to a hosting SQL server

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack admin portal as a service admin

2. Click **Resource Providers** &gt; **SQLAdapter** &gt; **Hosting Servers** &gt; **+Add**.

	The **SQL Hosting Servers** blade is where you can connect the SQL Server Resource Provider to actual instances of SQL Server that serve as the resource provider’s backend.

	![Hosting Servers](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/multiplehostingservers.PNG)

3. Fill the form with the connection details of your SQL Server instance. By default, a preconfigured SQL Server instance called <VM Name - see above>.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external” with the administrator user name "sa" and the password you provided in the "LocalCredential" parameter is running on the VM. Specify the maximum size of the server (for all databases).

	![New Hosting Server](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/sqlrp-newhostingserver.PNG)

4. 	As you add servers, you will need to assign them to a new or existing SKU. This allows differentiation of service offerings. For example, you could have a SQL Enterprise instance providing database capacity and automatic backup, reserve high performance servers for individual departments, etc. The SKU name should reflect the properties so that tenants can place their databases appropriately and all hosting servers in a SKU should have the same capabilities.

	An example:

	![SKUs](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/sqlrp-newsku.png)


## Create your first SQL Database to test your deployment

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack admin portal as service admin.

2. Click **+ New** &gt;**Data + Storage"** &gt; **SQL Server Database (preview)** &gt; **Add**

3. Fill in the form with database details, including a **Database Name**, **Maximum Size**, and change the other parameters as necessary. Fill in the Login Settings: **Database login**, and **Password**. These is a SQL Authentication credential that will be created for your access to this database only. The login user name must be globally unique.

	![New database](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/newsqldb.png)


4. You are asked to pick a SKU for your database. As hosting servers are added, they are assigned a SKU and databases are created in that pool of hosting servers that make up the SKU.

	![Pick a SKU](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/sqlrp-select-sku.png)


5. Submit the form and wait for the deployment to complete.

6. In the resulting blade, notice the “Connection string” field. You can use that string in any application that requires SQL Server access (for example, a web app) in your Azure Stack.

	![Retrieve the connection string](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/11.png)

## Add Capacity

Add Capacity by adding additional SQL hosts	in the Azure Stack portal and associate them wtih the appropriate SKU(s). If you wish to use another instance of SQL instead of the one installed on the provider VM, click **Resource Providers** &gt; **SQLAdapter** &gt; **SQL Hosting Servers** &gt; **+Add**.

## Making SQL databases available to tenants

Create plans and offers to make SQL databases available for tenants. You will need to create a plan, add the Microsoft.SqlAdapter service to the plan, and add an existing Quota, or create a new one. If you create a quota, you can specify the capacity to allow the tenant.
	![Create plans and offers to include databases](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/12.png)

## Tenant Usage of the Resource Provider

Self-service databases are provided through the tenant portal experience. Once the administrator has performed the above steps, a tenant will need to register the resource provider before they will be able to create databases.

The easiest way to do this is for the tenant to navigate to each subscription that includes a plan with the SQL Adapter, and click the **Register** label in the UI, as shown below:

![Register the SQL Adapter RP](./media/azure-stack-sql-rp-deploy/Register-RPs.PNG)

To do so from PowerShell instead, the following command can be executed:

```
Register-AzureRMResourceProvider –ProviderNamespace Microsoft.SQLAdapter
```

## Removing the SQL Adapter Resource Provider

In order to remove the resource provider, it is essential to first remove any dependencies.

1. Ensure you have the original deployment package that you downloaded for this version of the Resource Provider.

2. All tenant databases must be deleted from the resource provider (this will not delete the data). This should be performed by the tenants themselves.

3. Tenants must unregister from the namespace.

4. Administrator must delete the hosting servers from the SQL Adapter

5. Administrator must delete any plans that reference the SQL Adapter.

6. Administrator must delete any SKUs and quotas associated to the SQL Adapter.

7. Rerun the deployment script with the -Uninstall parameter, Azure Resource Manager endpoints, DirectoryTenantID, and credentials for the service administrator account.
