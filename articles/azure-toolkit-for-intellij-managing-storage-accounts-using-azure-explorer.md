# Manage storage accounts by using the Azure Explorer for IntelliJ

The Azure Explorer, which is part of the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ, provides Java developers with an easy-to-use solution for managing storage accounts in their Azure account from inside the IntelliJ integrated development environment (IDE).

[!INCLUDE [azure-toolkit-for-intellij-show-azure-explorer](../includes/azure-toolkit-for-intellij-show-azure-explorer.md)]

## Create a storage account in IntelliJ

To create a storage account by using the Azure Explorer, do the following:

1. Sign in to your Azure account by using the [Sign-in instructions for the Azure Toolkit for Eclipse]. 

2. In the **Azure Explorer** view, expand the **Azure** node, right-click **Storage Accounts**, and then click **Create Storage Account**.

   ![Create Storage Account command][CS01]

3. In the **Create Storage Account** dialog box, specify the following options:

   ![Create New Storage Account dialog box][CS02]

   * **Name**: Specifies the name for the new storage account.

   * **Account kind**: Specifies the type of storage account to create (for example, "Blob storage"). For more information, see [About Azure storage accounts]. 

   * **Performance**: Specifies which storage account offering to use from the selected publisher (for example, "Premium"). For more information, see [Azure storage scalability and performance targets]. 

   * **Replication**: Specifies the replication for the storage account (for example, "Zone-Redundant"). For more information, see [Azure storage replication]. 

   * **Subscription**: Specifies the Azure subscription that you want to use for the new storage account.

   * **Location**: Specifies the location where your storage account will be created (for example, "West US").

   * **Resource Group**: Specifies the resource group for your virtual machine. Select one of the following options:
      * **Create new**: Specifies that you want to create a new resource group.
      * **Use existing**: Specifies that you will select from a list of resource groups that are associated with your Azure account.

4. When you have specified all of the preceding options, click **OK**.

## Create a storage container in IntelliJ

To create a storage container by using the Azure Explorer, do the following:

1. In the Azure Explorer view, right-click the storage account where you want to create a container, and then click **Create blob container**.

   ![Create blob container command][CC01]

2. In the **Create blob container** dialog box, specify the name for your container, and then click **OK**. For more information about naming storage containers, see [Naming and referencing containers, blobs, and metadata].

   ![Create Storage Container Dialog Box][CC02]

## Delete a storage container in IntelliJ

To delete a storage container by using the Azure Explorer, do the following:

1. In the Azure Explorer view, right-click the storage container, and then click **Delete**.

   ![Delete storage container command][DC01]

2. In the confirmation window, click **Yes**.

   ![Delete storage container confirmation window][DC02]
