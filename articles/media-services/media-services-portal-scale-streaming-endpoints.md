# Scale streaming endpoints with the Azure portal
## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 
> 
> 

This topic is useful for customers who have **Streaming Endpoint** of the **Premium** type. For more information about streaming endpoint types and CDN configuration, see the [Streaming Endpoint overview](media-services-portal-manage-streaming-endpoints.md) topic.
 
When you have a **Premium** type, by default you get 1 streaming unit (SU). If you need to scale your streaming endpoint, follow the steps in this topic.

For information about pricing details, see [Media Services Pricing Details](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=275107).

## Scale streaming endpoints

To create and change the number of streaming units, do the following:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select your Azure Media Services account.
2. In the **Settings** window, select **Streaming endpoints**.
3. Click on the streaming endpoint that you want to scale. 
4. Move the slider to specify the number of streaming units.
