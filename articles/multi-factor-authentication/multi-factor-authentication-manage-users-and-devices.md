# Manage user settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud
As an administrator, you can manage the following user and device settings:

* Require users to provide contact methods again
* Delete app passwords
* Require MFA on all trusted devices 

## Require users to provide contact methods again
This setting forces the user to complete the registration process again when he or she signs in. Be aware that non-browser apps will continue to work if the user has app passwords for them.  You can delete the users app passwords by also selecting **Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users**.

### How to require users to provide contact methods again
1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. On the left, select **Active Directory**.
3. Select the directory for the user whose settings you want to manage.
4. At the top, select **Users**.
5. At the bottom of the page, select **Manage Multi-Factor Auth**. The multi-factor authentication page opens.
6. Check the box next to the user or users that you wish to manage. A list of quick step options appear on the right. 
7. Select **Manage user settings**.
8. Check the box for **Require selected users to provide contact methods again**.

9. Click **save**.
10. Click **close**.

## Delete users existing app passwords
This setting deletes all of the app passwords that a user has created. Non-browser apps that were associated with these app passwords will cease to work until a new app password is created.

### How to delete users existing app passwords
1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. On the left, select **Active Directory**.
3. Select the directory for the user whose settings you want to manage.
4. At the top, select **Users**.
5. At the bottom of the page, select **Manage Multi-Factor Auth**. The multi-factor authentication page opens.
6. Check the box next to the user or users that you wish to manage. A list of quick step options appear on the right.

9. Click **save**.
10. Click **close**.

## Restore MFA on all remembered devices for a user
One of the configurable features of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication is giving your users the option to mark devices as trusted. For more information, see [Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication settings](multi-factor-authentication-whats-next.md#remember-multi-factor-authentication-for-devices-that-users-trust).

Users can choose to opt out of two-step verification for a configurable number of days on their regular devices. If an account is compromised or a trusted device is lost, you need to be able to remove the trusted status and require two-step verification again.

The **Restore multi-factor authentication on all remembered devices** setting means that the user will be challenged to perform two-step verification the next time they sign in, regardless of whether they chose to mark their device as trusted. 

### How to restore MFA on all suspended devices for a user
1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. On the left, select **Active Directory**.
3. Select the directory for the user whose settings you want to manage.
4. At the top, select **Users**.
5. At the bottom of the page, select **Manage Multi-Factor Auth**. The multi-factor authentication page opens.
6. Check the box next to the user or users that you wish to manage. A list of quick step options appear on the right. 
7. Select **Manage user settings**.
8. Check the box for **Restore multi-factor authentication on all remembered devices**

9. Click **save**.
10. Click **close**.
