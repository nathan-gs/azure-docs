# How to use the Azure Marketplace Seller Insights portal

This article discusses how administrators access the Seller Insights portal, add or delete users, and set permissions for users.

## Onboard users

This section discusses how administrators access the Seller Insights portal for the first time. The tasks in this section are reserved for administrators. 


### Overview of roles

The Seller Insights portal administrator adds users, edits users, and delete users.

A Seller Insights portal user can view all data that is available to your organization.

Administrators and users are required to authenticate by using a valid [Microsoft account](http://signup.live.com), or your organizations's work or school account. Ensure that the new account ID is associated with a monitored mailbox.

![Type of account][5]



### Invitation to activate your account

Before signing in to the Seller Insights portal, the administrator should identify the accounts of the individuals they want to set up as users. Set up users with a work or school account, or a Microsoft account.

To activate your service, the administrator should go to the [URL address](https://reports.azure.com) that appears in the invitation email.

>[!NOTE]
>If the administrator email is listed as a Microsoft account, and you have not created a Microsoft account that's associated with the email address from which you received the invitation, you need to [create the account](https://signup.live.com) before you sign in.


### Administrator sign-in to the Seller Insights portal

1. Sign in to the Seller Insights portal by clicking the URL in the email that is sent to you.
2. Enter the administrator email address and password.

>[!NOTE]
>The administrator is the owner of the account that publishes solutions to the Azure Marketplace. The owner of this account can provide access to others.  If you have access to the publishing portal as a co-administrator, you can find the administrator address by following these steps:
>1. Sign in to the publishing portal.
>2. Click the **Publishers** tab.
>3. Open the publisher in question (usually there is just one).
>4. Click **Administrators** on the lower left.
>5. The administrator email address that you're looking for is labeled *Owner*.


You can sign in to the Seller Insights portal by using a personal Microsoft account, or by using a work or school account. The kind of account depends on what your administrator sets up in your profile. Your administrator should advise you about the account you use.

## Reset a password

**Account and password validation**

1. *Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password doesn't work.* If you enter an account that is registered in Azure Active Directory, it automatically prompts you to choose how to sign in with the account. You use a work or school account, or a Microsoft account that serves as your personal account.
2. Go to [https://reports.azure.com](https://reports.azure.com) and sign out of any account that you may be signed in with. You can also open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are signed in.
3. Enter the publisher's email address, but don't enter a password. If it's registered in Azure Active Directory, it will redirect to step 4.

    >[!NOTE]
    >Administrator accounts are registered. Work or school accounts that are set up by the administrator account are also registered.

4. Choose **Work or school account**. Work or school accounts are set up by companies that are registered with Azure. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >It's possible that a user set up a Microsoft account by using their organization's email address. In this scenario, the organization later onboards to Azure, and the same email address is registered as a work or school account. This user can have a Microsoft account with the same password that they used to create the work or school account. This user can also have a work or school account with a separate password that is used by their organization.

5. For the Seller Insights portal, when you select **Work or school account**, ensure that you use your work or school account password, and not a Microsoft account password.
6. A work or school account redirects you to the publisher's page to sign in.
7. From here, validate that the password for the work or school account works. If it doesn't work, continue to the "Password reset" section of this article.



**Password reset**

Use the following Microsoft and work or school accounts to reset your password.

>[!NOTE]
>For work or school accounts that are set up by the administrator account, if the administrator turned on the capability to let you reset your own password, you can reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your administrator.

* [Microsoft account](https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx)
![Password reset Microsoft account][3]

* [Work or school account](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/)
![Password reset work or school account][4]
