# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a .NET application using the Table API

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, and create a table within that account using the Azure portal. You'll then write code to insert, update, and delete entities, and run some queries using the new [Windows Azure Storage Premium Table](https://aka.ms/premiumtablenuget) (preview) package from NuGet. This library has the same classes and method signatures as the public [Windows Azure Storage SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage), but also has the ability to connect to Azure Cosmos DB accounts using the [Table API](table-introduction.md) (preview). 

## Prerequisites

If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-table.md)]

## Add a table

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-table](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-table.md)]

## Add sample data

You can now add data to your new table using Data Explorer (Preview).

1. In Data Explorer, expand **sample-table**, click **Entities**, and then click **Add Entity**.

   ![Create new entities in Data Explorer in the Azure portal](./media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-new-document.png)
2. Now add data to the PartitionKey value box and RowKey value box, and click **Add Entity**.

   ![Set the Partition Key and Row Key for a new entity](./media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-data-explorer-new-entity.png)
  
    You can now add more entities to your table, edit your entities, or query your data in Data Explorer. Data Explorer is also where you can scale your throughput and add stored procedures, user defined functions, and triggers to your table.

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Table app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `cd` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-table-dotnet-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the Program.cs file and you'll find that these lines of code create the Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

* The CloudTableClient is initialized.

    ```csharp
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(connectionString); 
    CloudTableClient tableClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudTableClient();
    ```

* A new table is created if it does not exist.

    ```csharp
    CloudTable table = tableClient.GetTableReference("people");
    table.CreateIfNotExists();
    ```

* A new Table container is created. You will notice this code very similar to regular Azure Table storage SDK. 

    ```csharp
    CustomerEntity item = new CustomerEntity()
                {
                    PartitionKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                    RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                    Email = $"{GetRandomString(6)}@contoso.com",
                    PhoneNumber = "425-555-0102",
                    Bio = GetRandomString(1000)
                };
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now we'll update the connection string information so your app can talk to Azure Cosmos DB. 

1. In Visual Studio, open the app.config file. 

2. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in the Azure Cosmos DB left navigation menu, click **Connection String**. Then in the new pane click the copy button for the connection string. 

    ![View and copy the Endpoint and Account Key in the Connection String pane](./media/create-table-dotnet/keys.png)

3. Paste the value into the app.config file as the value of the PremiumStorageConnectionString. 

    `<add key="PremiumStorageConnectionString" 
        value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=MYSTORAGEACCOUNT;AccountKey=AUTHKEY;TableEndpoint=https://COSMOSDB.documents.azure.com" />`    

    You can leave the StandardStorageConnectionString as is.

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Run the web app

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the **PremiumTableGetStarted** project in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**. 

2. In the NuGet **Browse** box, type *WindowsAzure.Storage-PremiumTable*.

3. Check the **Include prerelease** box. 

4. From the results, install the **WindowsAzure.Storage-PremiumTable** library. This installs the preview Azure Cosmos DB Table API package as well as all dependencies. Note that this is a different NuGet package than the Windows Azure Storage package used by Azure Table storage. 

5. Click CTRL + F5 to run the application.

    The console window displays the data being added, retrieved, queried, replaced and deleted from the table. When the script completes, press any key to close the console window. 
    
    ![Console output of the quickstart](./media/create-table-dotnet/azure-cosmosdb-table-quickstart-console-output.png)

6. If you want to see the new entities in Data Explorer, just comment out lines 188-208 in program.cs so they aren't deleted, then run the sample again. 

    You can now go back to Data Explorer, click **Refresh**, expand the **people** table and click **Entities**, and then work with this new data.

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-tutorial-review-slas](../../includes/cosmos-db-tutorial-review-slas.md)]

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps: 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a table using the Data Explorer, and run an app.  Now you can query your data using the Table API.
