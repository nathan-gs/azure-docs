# Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control
Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) comes with the following built-in roles that can be assigned to users, groups, and services. You canâ€™t modify the definitions of built-in roles. However, you can create [Custom roles in Azure RBAC](role-based-access-control-custom-roles.md) to fit the specific needs of your organization.

## Roles in Azure
The following table provides brief descriptions of the built-in roles. Click the role name to see the detailed list of **actions** and **notactions** for the role. The **actions** property specifies the allowed actions on Azure resources. Action strings can use wildcard characters. The **notactions** property specifies the actions that are excluded from the allowed actions.

The action defines what type of operations you can perform on a given resource type. For example:
- **Write** enables you to perform PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE operations.
- **Read** enables you to perform GET operations. 

This article only addresses the different roles that exist today. When you assign a role to a user, though, you can limit the allowed actions further by defining a scope. This is helpful if you want to make someone a Website Contributor, but only for one resource group. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure role definitions are constantly evolving. This article is kept as up to date as possible, but you can always find the latest roles definitions in Azure PowerShell. Use the [Get-AzureRmRoleDefinition](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermroledefinition) cmdlet to list all current roles. You can dive in to a specific role using `(get-azurermroledefinition "<role name>").actions` or `(get-azurermroledefinition "<role name>").notactions` as applicable. Use [Get-AzureRmProviderOperation](/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/get-azurermprovideroperation) to list operations of specific Azure resource providers.
