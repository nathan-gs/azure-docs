# View or search for your user groups in Azure Active Directory
This article explains how to view all groups in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). One of the features of Azure AD user management is that you can use groups to perform management tasks such as assigning licenses or permissions to a number of users at once.

## How do I see all the groups?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **More services**, enter **Users and groups** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **All groups**.

4. On the **Users and groups - All groups** blade, you can add or remove display columns, filter the list to search for a group, or make changes to groups that you have sufficient permissions to change.
