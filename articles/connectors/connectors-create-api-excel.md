# Get started with the Excel connector
There is no Excel connector in Logic Apps. 

## To use Excel data
You can store Excel data as a comma-separated value (CSV) file in a storage folder, such as [OneDrive](connectors-create-api-onedrive.md). You can also use this CSV file with the [flat-file connector](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md).

## Connector-specific details

View any triggers and actions defined in the swagger, and also see any limits in the [connector details](/connectors/excel/).

## More connectors
Go back to the [APIs list](apis-list.md).
