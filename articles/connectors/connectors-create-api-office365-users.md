# Get started with the Office 365 Users connector
Connect to Office 365 Users to get profiles, search users, and more. With Office 365 Users, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Office 365 Users. 
* Use actions that get direct reports, get a manager's user profile, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, get a person's direct reports, and then take this information and update a SQL Azure database. 

You can get started by creating a logic app now, see [Create a logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Create a connection to Office 365 Users
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must sign-in to your Office 365 Users account and allow logic apps to connect to your account.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Office 365 Users](../../includes/connectors-create-api-office365users.md)]
> 
> 

After you create the connection, you enter the Office 365 Users properties, like the user ID. The **REST API reference** in this topic describes these properties.
