# Create a virtual machine with Accelerated Networking

In this tutorial, you learn how to create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) with Accelerated Networking. Accelerated networking enables single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to a VM, greatly improving its networking performance. This high-performance path bypasses the host from the datapath reducing latency, jitter, and CPU utilization, for use with the most demanding network workloads on supported VM types. The following picture shows communication between two virtual machines (VM) with and without accelerated networking:

![Comparison](./media/virtual-network-create-vm-accelerated-networking/image1.png)

Without accelerated networking, all networking traffic in and out of the VM must traverse the host and the virtual switch. The virtual switch provides all policy enforcement, such as network security groups, access control lists, isolation, and other network virtualized services to network traffic. To learn more about virtual switches, read the [Hyper-V network virtualization and virtual switch](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj945275.aspx) article.

With accelerated networking, network traffic arrives at the VM's network interface (NIC), and is then forwarded to the VM. All network policies that the virtual switch applies without accelerated networking are offloaded and applied in hardware. Applying policy in hardware enables the NIC to forward network traffic directly to the VM, bypassing the host and the virtual switch, while maintaining all the policy it applied in the host.

The benefits of accelerated networking only apply to the VM that it is enabled on. For the best results, it is ideal to enable this feature on at least two VMs connected to the same Azure Virtual Network (VNet). When communicating across VNets or connecting on-premises, this feature has minimal impact to overall latency.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-preview](../../includes/virtual-network-preview.md)]

## Benefits
* **Lower Latency / Higher packets per second (pps):** Removing the virtual switch from the datapath removes the time packets spend in the host for policy processing and increases the number of packets that can be processed inside the VM.
* **Reduced jitter:** Virtual switch processing depends on the amount of policy that needs to be applied and the workload of the CPU that is doing the processing. Offloading the policy enforcement to the hardware removes that variability by delivering packets directly to the VM, removing the host to VM communication and all software interrupts and context switches.
* **Decreased CPU utilization:** Bypassing the virtual switch in the host leads to less CPU utilization for processing network traffic.

## <a name="Limitations"></a>Limitations
The following limitations exist when using this capability:

* **Network interface creation:** Accelerated networking can only be enabled for a new NIC. It cannot be enabled for an existing NIC.
* **VM creation:** A NIC with accelerated networking enabled can only be attached to a VM when the VM is created. The NIC cannot be attached to an existing VM.
* **Regions:** Windows VMs with accelerated networking are offered in most Azure regions. Linux VMs with accelerated networking are only offered in two regions: South Central US and West US 2. The regions this capability is available in will expand in the future.
* **Supported operating systems:** Windows: Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter and Windows Server 2016. Linux: Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS with kernel 4.4.0-77 or higher. Additional distributions will be added soon.
* **VM Size:** General purpose and compute-optimized instance sizes with eight or more cores. For more information, see the [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) and [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles. The set of supported VM instance sizes will expand in the future.

Changes to these limitations are announced through the [Azure Virtual Networking updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/accelerated-networking-in-preview) page.

## Create a Windows VM
You can use the Azure portal or Azure [PowerShell](#windows-powershell) to create the VM.

### <a name="windows-portal"></a>Portal

1. From an Internet browser, open the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure [account](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#account). If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p).
2. In the portal, click **+ New** > **Compute** > **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**.

## Create a Linux VM
You can use the Azure portal or Azure [PowerShell](#linux-powershell) to create the VM.

### <a name="linux-portal"></a>Portal
1. Register for the accelerated networking for Linux preview by completing steps 1-5 of the [Create a Linux VM - PowerShell](#linux-powershell) section of this article.  You cannot register for the preview in the portal.
2. Complete steps 1-8 in the [Create a Windows VM - portal](#windows-portal) section of this article. In step 2, click **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS** instead of **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**. For this tutorial, choose to use a password, rather than an SSH key, though for production deployments, you can use either. If **Accelerated networking** does not appear when you complete step 7 of the [Create a Windows VM - portal](#windows-portal) section of this article, it's likely for one of the following reasons:
    - You are not yet registered for the preview. Confirm that your registration state is **Registered**, as explained in step 4 of the [Create a Linux VM - Powershell](#linux-powershell) section of this article. **Note:** If you participated in the Accelerated networking for Windows VMs preview (it's no longer necessary to register to use Accelerated networking for Windows VMs), you are not automatically registered for the Accelerated networking for Linux VMs preview. You must register for the Accelerated networking for Linux VMs preview to participate in it.
    - You have not selected a VM size, operating system, or location listed in the [Limitations](#limitations) section of this article.
3. To install the accelerated networking driver for Linux, complete the steps in the [Configure Linux](#configure-linux) section of this article.

### <a name="linux-powershell"></a>PowerShell

>[!WARNING]
>If you create Linux VMs with accelerated networking in a subscription, and then attempt to create a Windows VM with accelerated networking in the same subscription, the Windows VM creation may fail. During this preview, it's recommended that you test Linux and Windows VMs with accelerated networking in separate subscriptions.
>

1. Install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell [AzureRm](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM/) module. If you're new to Azure PowerShell, read the [Azure PowerShell overview](/powershell/azure/get-started-azureps?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article.

6. In your PowerShell window, right-click to paste the script and start executing it. You are prompted for a username and password. Use these credentials to log in to the VM when connecting to it in the next step. If the script fails, confirm that:
    - You are registered for the preview, as explained in step 4
    - If you changed VM size, operating system type, or location values in the script before executing it, that the values are listed in the [Limitations](#Limitations) section of this article.
7. To install the accelerated networking driver for Linux, complete the steps in the [Configure Linux](#configure-linux) section of this article.

### <a name="configure-linux"></a>Configure Linux

Once you create the VM in Azure, you must install the accelerated networking driver for Linux. Before completing the following steps, you must have created a Linux VM with accelerated networking using either the [portal](#linux-portal) or [PowerShell](#linux-powershell) steps in this article. 

1. From an Internet browser, open the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with your Azure [account](../azure-glossary-cloud-terminology.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#account). If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p).
2. At the top of the portal, to the right of the *Search resources* bar, click the **>_** icon to start a Bash cloud shell (Preview). The Bash cloud shell pane appears at the bottom of the portal and after a few seconds, presents a **username@Azure:~$** prompt. Though you can SSH to the VM from your computer, rather than the cloud shell, the instructions in this tutorial assume you're using the cloud shell.
3. At the top of the portal, in the box that contains the text *Search resources*, type *MyVm*. When **MyVm** appears in the search results, click it.
4. In the **MyVm** blade that appears, click the **Connect** button in the top left corner of the blade. **Note:** If **Creating** is visible under the **Connect** button, Azure has not yet finished creating the VM. Click **Connect** only after you no longer see **Creating** under the **Connect** button.
5. Azure opens a box telling you to enter the `ssh adminuser@<ipaddress>`. Enter this command in the cloud shell (or copy it from the box that appeared in step 4 and paste it in to the cloud shell, then press Enter.
6. Enter **yes** to the question asking you if you want to continue connecting, then press Enter.
7. Enter the password you entered when creating the VM. Once successfully logged in to the VM, you see an adminuser@MyVm:~$ prompt. You are now logged in to the VM through the cloud shell session. **Note:** Cloud shell sessions time out after 10 minutes of inactivity.
8. At the prompt, enter `uname -r` and confirm the output matches the following version: “4.4.0-77-generic.”
9.	Create a bond between the standard networking vNIC and the accelerated networking vNIC by running the commands that follow. Network traffic uses the higher performing accelerated networking vNIC, while the bond ensures that networking traffic is not interrupted across certain configuration changes.

    ```bash
    wget https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/plain/tools/hv/bondvf.sh
 
    chmod +x ./bondvf.sh

    sudo ./bondvf.sh

    sudo mv ~/bondvf.sh /etc/init.d

    sudo update-rc.d bondvf.sh defaults
    ```

    If you receive an error that says *insserv: warning: script 'bondvf.sh' missing LSB tags and overrides*, you can disregard it.

10. Restart the VM by entering the `sudo shutdown -r now` command.
11. Once the VM is restarted, reconnect to it by completing steps 5-7 again.
12.	Run the `ifconfig` command and confirm that bond0 has come up and the interface is showing as UP. **Note:** Application using accelerated networking must communicate over the *bond0* interface, not *eth0*.  The interface name may change before accelerated networking reaches general availability.
