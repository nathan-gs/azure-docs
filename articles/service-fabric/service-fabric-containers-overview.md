# Service Fabric and containers
> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in preview for Linux.  Deploying containers to a Service Fabric cluster in Windows 10 isn't supported yet (coming soon). 
>   

## Introduction
Azure Service Fabric is an [orchestrator](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-introduction.md) of services across a cluster of machines, with years of usage and optimization in massive scale services at Microsoft. Services can be developed in many ways, from using the [Service Fabric programming models](service-fabric-choose-framework.md) to deploying [guest executables](service-fabric-deploy-existing-app.md). By default, Service Fabric deploys and activates these services as processes. Processes provide the fastest activation and highest density usage of the resources in a cluster. Service Fabric can also deploy services in container images. Importantly, you can mix services in processes and services in containers in the same application. 

## Containers and Service Fabric roadmap
In forthcoming releases, many improvements are planned for container orchestration with Service Fabric. Improvements include features for enhanced networking with support for virtual networks within an application, security features, improved diagnostics, and tooling support. Service Fabric allows you to create applications mixing containers packaged with existing code (for example, IIS MVC apps) with services developed using the Service Fabric programming models.  You can run several such applications on a single cluster. 

## What are containers?
Containers are encapsulated, individually deployable components that run as isolated instances on the same kernel to take advantage of virtualization that an operating system provides. Thus, each application and its runtime, dependencies, and system libraries run inside a container with full, private access to the container's own isolated view of operating system constructs. Along with portability, this degree of security and resource isolation is the main benefit for using containers with Service Fabric, which otherwise runs services in processes.

Containers are a virtualization technology that virtualizes the underlying operating system from applications. Containers provide an immutable environment for applications to run with varying degrees of isolation. Containers run directly on top of the kernel and have an isolated view of the file system and other resources. Compared to virtual machines, containers have the following advantages:

* **Small**: Containers use a single storage space and layer versions and updates to increase efficiency.
* **Fast**: Containers donâ€™t have to boot an entire operating system, so they can start much faster, typically in seconds.
* **Portability**: A containerized application image can be ported to run in the cloud, on premises, inside virtual machines, or directly on physical machines.
* **Resource governance**: A container can limit the physical resources that it can consume on its host.

## Container types
Service Fabric supports containers on both Linux and Windows, and also supports Hyper-V isolation mode on the latter. 

### Docker containers on Linux
Docker provides high-level APIs to create and manage containers on top of Linux kernel containers. Docker Hub is a central repository to store and retrieve container images.
For a tutorial, see [Deploy a Docker container to Service Fabric](service-fabric-deploy-container-linux.md).

### Windows Server containers
Windows Server 2016 provides two different types of containers that differ in the level of provided isolation. Windows Server containers and Docker containers are similar because both have namespace and file system isolation but share the kernel with the host they are running on. On Linux, this isolation has traditionally been provided by `cgroups` and `namespaces`, and Windows Server containers behave similarly.

Windows Hyper-V containers provide more isolation and security because each container does not share the operating system kernel with other containers or with the host. With this higher level of security isolation, Hyper-V containers are targeted at hostile, multitenant scenarios.
For a tutorial, see [Deploy a Windows container to Service Fabric](service-fabric-deploy-container.md).

The following figure shows the different types of virtualization and isolation levels available in the operating system.

## Scenarios for using containers
Here are typical examples where a container is a good choice:

* **IIS lift and shift**: If you have existing [ASP.NET MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) apps that you want to continue to use, put them in a container instead of migrating them to ASP.NET Core. These ASP.NET MVC apps depend on Internet Information Services (IIS). You can package these applications into container images from the precreated IIS image and deploy them with Service Fabric. See [Container Images on Windows Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start_images) for information about how to create IIS images.
* **Mix containers and Service Fabric microservices**: Use an existing container image for part of your application. For example, you might use the [NGINX container](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) for the web front end of your application and stateful services for the more intensive back-end computation.
* **Reduce impact of "noisy neighbors" services**: You can use the resource governance ability of containers to restrict the resources that a service uses on a host. If services might consume many resources and affect the performance of others (such as a long-running, query-like operation), consider putting these services into containers that have resource governance.

## Service Fabric support for containers
Service Fabric currently supports deployment of Docker containers on Linux and Windows Server containers on Windows Server 2016, along with support for Hyper-V isolation mode. 

In the Service Fabric [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), a container represents an application host in which multiple service replicas are placed. Service Fabric can run any containers, and the scenario is similar to the [guest executable scenario](service-fabric-deploy-existing-app.md), where you package an existing application inside a container. This scenario is the common use-case for containers, and examples include running an application written using any language or frameworks, but not using the built-in Service Fabric programming models.

In addition, you can run Service Fabric services inside containers as well. Support for running Service Fabric services inside containers is limited currently, but to be enhanced in forthcoming releases.

* **Reliable Stateless services inside containers**: Reliable Stateless services using the Reliable Services programming models are only supported on Linux. Support for Reliable Stateless services in Windows containers is planned for a future release.
* **Stateful services inside containers**: These services use the Reliable Actors or Reliable Services programming model. Support for running stateful services in containers will be added in future release.

Service Fabric has several container capabilities that help you build applications that are composed of microservices that are containerized. Service Fabric offers the following capabilities for containerized services:

* Container image deployment and activation.
* Resource governance.
* Repository authentication.
* Container port to host port mapping.
* Container-to-container discovery and communication.
* Ability to configure and set environment variables.

## Next steps
In this article, you learned about containers, that Service Fabric is a container orchestrator, and that Service Fabric has features that support containers. As a next step, we will go over examples of each of the features to show you how to use them.
