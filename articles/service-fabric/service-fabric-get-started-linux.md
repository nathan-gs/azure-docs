# Prepare your development environment on Linux

 To deploy and run [Azure Service Fabric applications](service-fabric-application-model.md) on your Linux development machine, install the runtime and common SDK. You can also install optional SDKs for Java and .NET Core.

## Prerequisites

### Supported operating system versions
The following operating system versions are supported for development:

* Ubuntu 16.04 (`Xenial Xerus`)

## Update your apt sources
To install the SDK and the associated runtime package via apt-get, you must first update your apt sources.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Add the Service Fabric repo to your sources list.

    ```bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/servicefabric/ trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/servicefabric.list'
    ```

3. Add the `dotnet` repo to your sources list.

    ```bash
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet-release/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
    ```

4. Add the new GPG key to your apt keyring.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver apt-mo.trafficmanager.net --recv-keys 417A0893
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 417A0893
    ```

5. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key to your apt keyring.

    ```bash
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

6. Set up the Docker repository.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```

7. Refresh your package lists based on the newly added repositories.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

## Install and set up the SDK for containers and guest executables

Once your sources are updated, you can install the SDK.

1. Install the Service Fabric SDK package. You are asked to confirm the installation and to agree to a license agreement.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install servicefabricsdkcommon
    ```

   The following commands automate accepting the license for Service Fabric packages:

    ```bash
    echo "servicefabric servicefabric/accepted-eula-v1 select true" | debconf-set-selections
    echo "servicefabricsdkcommon servicefabricsdkcommon/accepted-eula-v1 select true" | debconf-set-selections
    ```

2. Run the SDK setup script.

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/microsoft/sdk/servicefabric/common/sdkcommonsetup.sh
    ```

Once you have run the steps to install the Common SDK package, creation of apps with guest executable or container services should be possible by running `yo azuresfguest` or `yo azuresfcontainer`. You may need to set your **$NODE_PATH** environment variable to where the node modules are located. 


```bash
    export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:$HOME/.node/lib/node_modules 
```

If you are using the environment as root, you may need to set the variable with the following command:

```bash
    export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/root/.node/lib/node_modules 
```


> [!TIP]
> You may want to add these commands into your ~/.bashrc file so that you don't have to set the environment variable at every login.
>

## Set up the Azure CLI
The [Azure CLI][azure-xplat-cli-github] includes commands for interacting with Service Fabric entities, including clusters and applications. It is based on Node.js so [ensure that you have installed Node][install-node] before proceeding with the following instructions:

1. Clone the github repo to your development machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli.git
    ```

2. Switch into the cloned repo and install the CLI's dependencies using the Node Package Manager (npm).

    ```bash
    cd azure-xplat-cli
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a symlink from the `bin/azure` folder of the cloned repo to `/usr/bin/azure`.

    ```bash
    sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/azure /usr/bin/azure
    ```

4. Finally, enable auto-completion Service Fabric commands.

    ```bash
    azure --completion >> ~/azure.completion.sh
    echo 'source ~/azure.completion.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/azure.completion.sh
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Service Fabric commands are not yet available in Azure CLI 2.0.


## Set up a local cluster
If everything has installed successfully, you should be able to start a local cluster.

1. Run the cluster setup script.

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/microsoft/sdk/servicefabric/common/clustersetup/devclustersetup.sh
    ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:19080/Explorer. If the cluster has started, you should see the Service Fabric Explorer dashboard.

    ![Service Fabric Explorer on Linux][sfx-linux]

At this point, you are able to deploy pre-built Service Fabric application packages or new ones based on guest containers or guest executables. To build new services using the Java or .NET Core SDKs, follow the optional setup steps provided in subsequent sections.


> [!NOTE]
> Stand alone clusters aren't supported in Linux - only one box and Azure Linux multi-machine clusters are supported in the preview.
>

## Install the Java SDK (optional, if you wish to use the Java programming models)
The Java SDK provides the libraries and templates required to build Service Fabric services using Java.

1. Install the Java SDK package.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install servicefabricsdkjava
    ```

2. Run the SDK setup script.

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/microsoft/sdk/servicefabric/java/sdkjavasetup.sh
    ```

## Install the Eclipse Neon plugin (optional)

You can install the Eclipse plugin for Service Fabric from within the **Eclipse IDE for Java Developers**. You can use Eclipse to create Service Fabric guest executable applications and container applications in addition to Service Fabric Java applications.

> [!NOTE]
> The Java SDK is a prerequisite to using the Eclipse plugin, even if you only use it for guest executables and container applications.
>

1. In Eclipse, ensure that you have latest eclipse **Neon** and latest Buildship version (1.0.17 or later) installed. You can check the versions of installed components by choosing **Help > Installation Details**. You can update Buildship using the instructions [here][buildship-update].
2. To install the Service Fabric plugin, choose **Help > Install New Software...**
3. In the "Work with" textbox, enter: http://dl.microsoft.com/eclipse
4. Click Add.

    ![Eclipse plugin][sf-eclipse-plugin]

5. Choose the Service Fabric plugin and click **Next**.
6. Proceed through the installation and accept the end-user license agreement.

If you already have the Service Fabric Eclipse plugin installed, make sure you are on the latest version. You can check by selecting ``Help => Installation Details`` and searching for Service Fabric in the list of installed plugins. Select update if a newer version is available.

For more information, see [Service fabric getting started with Eclipse](service-fabric-get-started-eclipse.md).


## Install the .NET Core SDK (optional, if you wish to use the .NET Core programming models)
The .NET Core SDK provides the libraries and templates required to build Service Fabric services using .NET Core.

1. Install the .NET Core SDK package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install servicefabricsdkcsharp
   ```

2. Run the SDK setup script.

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/microsoft/sdk/servicefabric/csharp/sdkcsharpsetup.sh
   ```

## Updating the SDK and Runtime

To update to the latest version of the SDK and runtime, run the following commands (deselect the SDKs that you don't want):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install servicefabric servicefabricsdkcommon servicefabricsdkcsharp servicefabricsdkjava
```


> [!NOTE]
> Updating the packages may result in your local development cluster being stopped. Restart your local cluster after an upgrade by following instructions on this page.
>
>

For updating the CLI, navigate to the directory where you cloned the CLI and run `git pull` for updating.  The release notes may contain additional steps.
