# Stream Analytics Resource health blade

The **Resource health** blade in the Azure portal shows the health of your Azure Stream Analytics jobs. It also shows actionable guidance that can help you troubleshoot problems. 

The **Resource health** blade is intended to help you determine more quickly whether the root of a problem is in the application, or if it is caused by an event in Azure. It can help you know when to open a support case to receive assistance.
