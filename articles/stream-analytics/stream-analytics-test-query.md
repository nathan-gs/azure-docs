# Test Azure Stream Analytics queries in the Azure portal

With Azure Stream Analytics, you can test queries in the Azure portal without needing to start or stop a job.

The output of your query is displayed in the browser, with Download results link should you want to save the test output for later use. You can now easily and iteratively modify your query and test it repeatedly to see how the output changes.
