# Tips for improving the performance and reliability of Azure Functions.

## Overview

This article provides a collection of best practices for you to
consider when implementing function apps. Keep in mind that your
function app is an app in Azure App Service, so App Service best practices also apply.


## Avoid large long running functions.

Large, long-running functions can cause unexpected timeout issues. A
function can become large due to many Node.js dependencies, since
importing these dependencies can cause increased load times resulting
in unexpected timeouts. These dependencies could be explicitly loaded
by multiple `require()` statements in your code, but they could also
be implicit, based on a single module loaded by your code that has its
own internal ones. 

Whenever possible, refactor large functions into smaller function sets
that work together and return responses fast. For example, a webhook
or HTTP trigger function might require an acknowledgment response
within a certain time limit; it is common for webhooks to require an
immediate response. You can pass the HTTP trigger payload into a queue
to be processed by a queue trigger function. This approach allows you
to defer the actual work and return an immediate response.


## Cross function communication.

When integrating multiple functions, it is generally a best practice to use storage queues for cross function communication.  The main reason is storage queues are cheaper and much easier to provision. 

Individual messages in a storage queue are limited in size to 64 KB. If you need to pass larger messages between functions, an Azure Service Bus queue could be used to support message sizes up to 256 KB.

Service Bus topics are useful if you require message filtering before processing.

Event hubs are useful to support high volume communications.



## Write functions to be stateless. 

Functions should be stateless and idempotent if possible. Associate any required state information with your data. For example, an order being processed would likely have an associated `state` member. A function could process an order based on that state while the function itself remains stateless. 

Idempotent functions are especially recommended with timer triggers. For example, if you have something that absolutely must run once a day, write it so it can run any time during the day with the same results. The function can exit when there is no work for a particular day. Also if a previous run failed to complete, the next run should pick up where it left off.


## Write defensive functions.

Assume your function could encounter an exception at any time. Design your functions with the ability to continue from a previous fail point during the next execution. Consider a scenario that requires the following actions:

1. Query for 10,000 rows in a db.
2. Create a queue message for each of those rows to process further down the line.
 
Depending on how complex your system is, you may have: involved downstream services behaving badly, networking outages, or quota limits reached, etc. All of these can affect your function at any time. You need to design your functions to be prepared for it.

How does your code react if a failure occurs after inserting 5,000 of those items into a queue for processing? Track items in a set that youâ€™ve completed. Otherwise, you might insert them again next time. This can have a serious impact on your work flow. 

If a queue item was already processed, allow your function to be a no-op.

Take advantage of defensive measures already provided for components you use in the Azure Functions platform. For example, see **Handling poison queue messages** in the documentation for [Azure Storage Queue triggers](functions-bindings-storage-queue.md#trigger).
 

## Don't mix test and production code in the same function app.

Functions within a function app share resources. For example, memory is shared. If you're using a function app in production, don't add test-related functions and resources to it. It can cause unexpected overhead during production code execution.

Be careful what you load in your production function apps. Memory is averaged across each function in the app.

If you have a shared assembly referenced in multiple .Net functions, put it in a common shared folder. Reference the assembly with a statement similar to the following example: 

	#r "..\Shared\MyAssembly.dll". 

Otherwise, it is easy to accidentally deploy multiple test versions of the same binary that behave differently between functions.

Don't use verbose logging in production code. It has a negative performance impact.



## Use async code but avoid Task.Result.

Asynchronous programming is a recommended best practice. However, always avoid referencing the `Task.Result` property. This approach can lead to thread exhaustion.
