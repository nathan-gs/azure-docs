# Your world in your words

With Microsoft Translator Hub you can build your own machine translation system using your preferred terminology and style specific to your industry, linguistic, domain, or organizational needs. You can use this system via the Microsoft Translator API in your own applications, in 3rd party applications, your website, the Bing Translator Widget, and a community of collaborators.
