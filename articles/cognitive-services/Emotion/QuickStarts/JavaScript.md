# Emotion API JavaScript Quick Start
This article provides information and code samples to help you quickly get started using the [Emotion API Recognize method](https://dev.projectoxford.ai/docs/services/5639d931ca73072154c1ce89/operations/563b31ea778daf121cc3a5fa) with JavaScript to recognize the emotions expressed by one or more people in an image.

## Prerequisite
* Get your free Subscription Key [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/)

## Recognize Emotions JavaScript Example Request

Copy the following and save it to a file such as `test.html`. Change the `url` to use the location where you obtained your subscription keys, and replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with your valid subscription key, and change the request body to the location of an image you want to use. To run the sample, drag-and-drop the file into your browser.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JSSample</title>
    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<script type="text/javascript">
    $(function() {
        var params = {
            // Request parameters
        };
      
        $.ajax({
            // NOTE: You must use the same location in your REST call as you used to obtain your subscription keys.
            //   For example, if you obtained your subscription keys from westcentralus, replace "westus" in the 
            //   URL below with "westcentralus".
            url: "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/emotion/v1.0/recognize?" + $.param(params),
            beforeSend: function(xhrObj){
                // Request headers
                xhrObj.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/json");

                // NOTE: Replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with a valid subscription key.
                xhrObj.setRequestHeader("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key","13hc77781f7e4b19b5fcdd72a8df7156");
            },
            type: "POST",
            // Request body
            data: '{"url": "http://www.example.com/images/image.jpg"}',
        })
        .done(function(data) {
            alert("success");
        })
        .fail(function() {
            alert("error");
        });
    });
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Recognize Emotions Sample Response
A successful call returns an array of face entries and their associated emotion scores, ranked by face rectangle size in descending order. An empty response indicates that no faces were detected. An emotion entry contains the following fields:
* faceRectangle - Rectangle location of face in the image.
* scores - Emotion scores for each face in the image. 

```json
application/json 
[
  {
    "faceRectangle": {
      "left": 68,
      "top": 97,
      "width": 64,
      "height": 97
    },
    "scores": {
      "anger": 0.00300731952,
      "contempt": 5.14648448E-08,
      "disgust": 9.180124E-06,
      "fear": 0.0001912825,
      "happiness": 0.9875571,
      "neutral": 0.0009861537,
