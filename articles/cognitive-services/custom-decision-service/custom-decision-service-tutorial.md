# Tutorial for Custom Decision Service

This tutorial focuses on personalizing the selection of articles on the front page of a website. In this example, we consider a typical scenario when Azure Custom Decision Service is applied to *multiple* lists of articles on the same front page. For concreteness, suppose we have a news website that covers only politics and sports. This website features three ranked lists of articles: politics, sports, and recent. We assume the news website has enough traffic for the [application-specific learning mode](custom-decision-service-overview.md#application-specific-learning-mode).

## Framing

First, let's explain how to fit your scenario into our framework. We create three applications, one for each list that is being optimized: respectively, app-politics, app-sports, and app-recent. To specify the candidate articles for each application, we maintain two action sets: one for politics and one for sports. The action set for app-recent is obtained automatically as a union of the other two.

> [!TIP]
> Action sets can be shared across applications in Custom Decision Service.

## Prepare action set feeds

Custom Decision Service consumes action sets via RSS or Atom feeds provided by the customer. In our scenario, you need to provide two feeds: one for politics and one for sports. For concreteness, suppose they are served from
`http://www.domain.com/feeds/<feed-name>`.

Each feed provides a list of articles. In RSS, each article is specified by an `<item>` element, as follows:

```xml
<rss version="2.0"><channel>
   <item>
      <title><![CDATA[article title]]></title>
      <link>"article url"</link>
      <pubDate>publication date</pubDate>
    </item>
</channel></rss>
```

The order of articles matters. It specifies the default ranking, which is your best guess for how the articles should be ordered. The default ranking is then used for performance comparison on the [dashboard](#performance-dashboard).

For more information on the feed format, see the [API reference](custom-decision-service-api-reference.md#action-set-api-customer-provided).

## Register a new app

1. Sign in with your [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account). On the ribbon, click **My Portal**.

2. To register a new application, click the **New App** button.

    ![Custom Decision Service portal](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/portal.png)

3. Enter a unique name for your application in the **App ID** text box. If this name is already in use by another customer, the system asks you to pick a different app ID. Select the **Advanced** check box, and enter the [connection string](../../storage/storage-configure-connection-string.md) for your Azure storage account. Normally, you use the same storage account for all your applications.

    ![New app dialog box](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/new-app-dialog.png)

    After you register all three applications in our scenario, they are listed as follows:

    ![List of apps](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/apps.png)

    You can come back to this list by clicking the **Apps** button.

4. In the **New App** dialog box, specify an action feed. Action feeds can also be specified by clicking the **Feeds** button and then by clicking the **New Feed** button. Enter a **Name** for the new feed, enter the **URL** from which it is served, and enter the **Refresh Time**. The refresh time specifies how frequently Custom Decision Service should refresh the feed.

    ![New feed dialog box](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/new-feed-dialog.png)

    Action feeds can be used by any app, regardless of where they are specified. After you specify both action feeds in our scenario, they are listed as follows:

    ![List of feeds](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/feeds.png)

    You can come back to this list by clicking the **Feeds** button.

## Use the APIs

Custom Decision Service serves rankings of articles via the Ranking API. To invoke this API, insert the following code into the HTML head of the front page:

```html
<!-- Define the "callback function" to render UI -->
<script> function callback(data) { â€¦ } </script>

<!--  call Ranking API after callback() is defined, separately for each app -->
<script src="https://ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/app-politics/rank/feed-politics" async></script>
<script src="https://ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/app-sports/rank/feed-sports" async></script>
<script src="https://ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/app-recent/rank/feed-politics/feed-sports" async></script>
<!-- NB: action feeds for 'app-recent' are listed one after another. -->
```

The HTTP response from the Ranking API is a JSONP-formatted string. For app-politics, for example, the string looks like this:

```json
callback({
   "ranking":[{"id":"url1"}, {"id":"url2"}, {"id":"url3"}],
   "eventId":"<opaque event string>",
   "appId":"app-politics",
   "actionSets":[{"id":"feed-politics","lastRefresh":"date"}] });
```

The browser then executes this string as a call to the `callback()` function. The `data` argument in the `callback()` function contains the app ID and the ranking of URLs to be rendered. In particular, `callback()` should use `data.appId` to distinguish between the three applications. `eventId` is used internally by Custom Decision Service to match the provided ranking with the corresponding click, if any.

> [!TIP]
> `callback()` might check each action feed for freshness by using the `lastRefresh` field. If a given feed is not sufficiently fresh, `callback()` might ignore the provided ranking, call this feed directly, and use the default ranking served by the feed.

For more information on specifications and additional options provided by the Ranking API, see the [API reference](custom-decision-service-api-reference.md).

Clicks on the top article are returned by calling the Reward API. When a click on the top article is received, the following code should be invoked on the front page:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: '//ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/<appId>/reward/<eventId>',
    contentType: "application/json" })
```

Using `appId` and `eventId` in the click-handling code requires some care. For example, you can implement the `callback()` function as follows:

```javascript
function callback(data) {
    $.map(data.ranking, function (element) {
        //custom rendering function given content info
        render({appId:data.appId,
                article:element,
                onClick: element.id != data.rewardAction ? null :
                   function() {
                       $.ajax({
                       type: "POST",
                       url: '//ds.microsoft.com/api/v2/' + data.appId + '/reward/' + data.eventId,
                       contentType: "application/json" })}
                });
}}
```

In this example, implement the `render()` function to render a given article for a given application. This function inputs the app ID and the article (in the format from the Ranking API). The `onClick` parameter is the function that should be called from `render()` to handle a click. It checks whether the click is on the top slot. Then it calls the Reward API with the appropriate app ID and event ID.

## Use the performance dashboard

We provide a dashboard to track performance. To see the dashboard for a given app, such as app-sports, go to the list of apps, as explained previously. Click the **Dashboard** link for the app.

![Link to dashboard](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/apps-dashboard-link.png)

The dashboard shows three plots:

- Actual performance of Custom Decision Service (online)
- Counterfactual performance estimate for the default ranking; estimated performance if this ranking is deployed (default policy)
- Counterfactual performance estimate for Custom Decision Service (latest policy)

The counterfactual performance estimate for Custom Decision Service should closely track its online performance. We provide this plot as a check for our counterfactual evaluation methodology.

![Dashboard](./media/custom-decision-service-tutorial/dashboard.png)

The Y axis corresponds to rewards. Currently, a ranking is assigned reward 1 if the top slot is clicked; otherwise, it is 0. Rewards are expressed as running averages over a short time window. Currently, the time window is one hour.

We also provide upper and lower confidence bounds for our counterfactual estimates. To see the upper and lower bounds, select the **bounds** check box in the upper-right corner.
