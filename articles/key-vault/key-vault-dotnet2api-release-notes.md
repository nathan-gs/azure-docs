# Azure Key Vault .NET 2.0 - Release Notes and Migration Guide
The following notes and guidance are for developers working with Azure Key Vault .NET / C# library. In the transition from the 1.0 version to the 2.0 version, a number of updates have been made that will require migration work in your code in order for you to benefit from the functional improvements and feature additions such as **Key Vault certificates** support.

## Key Vault certificates

Key Vault certificates support provides for management of your x509 certificates and the following behaviors:  

* Allows a certificate owner to create a certificate through a Key Vault creation process or through the import of an existing certificate. This includes both self-signed and Certificate Authority generated certificates.
* Allows a Key Vault certificate owner to implement secure storage and management of X509 certificates without interaction with private key material.  
* Allows a certificate owner to create a policy that directs Key Vault to manage the life-cycle of a certificate.  
* Allows certificate owners to provide contact information for notification about life-cycle events of expiration and renewal of certificate.  
* Supports automatic renewal with selected issuers - Key Vault partner X509 certificate providers / certificate authorities.
  
  * NOTE - Non-partnered providers/authorities are also allowed but, will not support the auto renewal feature.

## .NET support

* **.NET 4.0** is not supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET/C# library
* **.NET Core** is supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET/C# library

## Namespaces

* The namespace for **models** is changed from **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault** to **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Models**.
* The **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Internal** namespace is dropped.
* The Azure SDK dependencies namespace are changed from **Hyak.Common** and **Hyak.Common.Internals** to **Microsoft.Rest** and **Microsoft.Rest.Serialization**

## Type changes

* *Secret* changed to *SecretBundle*
* *Dictionary* changed to *IDictionary*
* *List<T>, string []* changed to *IList<T>*
* *NextList* changed to  *NextPageLink*

## Return types

* **KeyList** and **SecretList** will return *IPage<T>* instead of *ListKeysResponseMessage*
* The generated **BackupKeyAsync** will return *BackupKeyResult* which contains *Value* (back-up blob). Before the method was wrapped and returning only the value.

## Exceptions

* *KeyVaultClientException* is changed to *KeyVaultErrorException*
* The service error is changed from *exception.Error* to *exception.Body.Error.Message*.
* Removed additional info from the error message for **[JsonExtensionData]**.

## Constructors

* Instead of accepting an *HttpClient* as a constructor argument, the constructor only accepts *HttpClientHandler* or *DelegatingHandler[]*.
