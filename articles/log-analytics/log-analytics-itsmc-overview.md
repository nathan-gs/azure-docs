# Centrally manage ITSM work items using IT Service Management Connector (Preview)

![IT Service Management Connector symbol](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-symbol.png)

You can use the IT Service Management Connector (ITSMC) in OMS Log Analytics to centrally monitor and manage work items across your ITSM products/services.

The IT Service Management Connector integrates your existing IT Service Management (ITSM) products and services with OMS Log Analytics.  The solution has bidirectional integration with ITSM products/services, where it provides the OMS users an option to create incidents, alerts, or events in ITSM solution. The connector also  imports data such as incidents, and change requests from ITSM solution into OMS Log Analytics.

With IT Service Management Connector, you can:

  - Centrally monitor and manage work items for ITSM products/services used across your organization.
  - Create ITSM work items (like alert, event, incident) in ITSM from OMS alerts and through log search.
  - Read incidents and change requests from your ITSM solution and correlate with relevant log data in Log Analytics workspace.
  - Find any unexpected and unusual events and resolve them, even before the end users call and report them to the helpdesk.
  - Import work items data into Log Analytics and create key performance indicator (KPI) reports.  Using these reports, you can identify, assess and act on several important items such as malware assessment.
  - View curated dashboards for deeper insights on incidents, change requests and impacted systems.
  - Troubleshoot faster by correlating with other management solutions in the Log Analytics workspace.


## Prerequisites

To import the ITSM work items into OMS Log Analytics, the solution requires a connection between the IT Service Management Connector in the OMS and the IT SM product/service from which you import the work items.


## Configuration

Add the IT Service Management Connector solution to your OMS work space, using the process described in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).

## IT Service Management connector – integration with other OMS solutions

IT Service Management Connector, currently supports integration with the Service Map solution.

Service Map automatically discovers the application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It allows you to view your servers as you think of them – as interconnected systems that deliver critical services. Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture with no configuration required other than installation of an agent. More information: [Service Map](../operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-service-map.md).

With this integration, you can view the service desk items created in the ITSM solutions as shown in the following example:

![Integrated solution ](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-overview-integrated-solutions.png)
## Create ITSM work items for OMS alerts

For the OMS alerts, you can create associated work items in the connected ITSM sources.  To do this, use the following procedure:

1. From **Log Search** window, run a log search query to view data. Query results are the source for work items.
2. In **Log Search**, click **Alert** to open the **Add Alert Rule** page.

    ![Log Analytics screen](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-work-items-for-oms-alerts.png)

3. On the **Add Alert Rule** window, provide the required details for **Name**, **Severity**,  **Search query**, and **Alert criteria** (Time Window/Metric measurement).
4. Select **Yes** for **ITSM Actions**.
5. Select your ITSM connection from the **Select Connection** list.
6. Provide the details as required.
7. To create a separate work item for each log entry of this alert, select the **Create individual work items for each log entry** checkbox.

    Or

    leave this checkbox unselected to create only one work item for any number of log entries under this alert.

7. Click **Save**.

The OMS alert will be created under **Alerts**. The corresponding ITSM connection's work items are created when the specified alert's condition is met.

## Create ITSM work items from OMS logs

You can create work items in the connected ITSM sources by using OMS Log Search. To do this, use the following procedure:

1. From **Log Search**,  search the required data, select the detail, and click **Create work item**.

    The **Create ITSM Work item** window appears:

    ![Log Analytics screen](media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-work-items-from-oms-logs.png)

2.   Add the following details:

  - **Work item Title**: Title for the work item.
  - **Work item Description**: Description for the new work item.
  - **Affected Computer**: Name of the computer where this log data was found.
  - **Select Connection**:  ITSM connection in which you want to create this work item.
  - **Work item**:  Type of work item.

3. To use an existing work item template for an incident, click **Yes** under **Generate work item based on the template** option and then click **Create**.

    Or,

    Click **No** if you want to provide your customized values.

4. Provide the appropriate values in the **Contact Type**, **Impact**, **Urgency**, **Category**, and **Sub Category** text boxes, and then click **Create**.

The work item will be created in the ITSM, which you can also view in OMS.

## Troubleshoot ITSM connections in OMS
1.	If connection fails from connected source's UI and you get the **Error in saving connection** message, do the following:
 - In case of ServiceNow, Cherwell and Provance connections, ensure you correctly entered  the username/password and  client ID/client secret  for each of the connections. If the error persists, check if you have sufficient privileges  in the corresponding ITSM product to make the connection.
 - In case of Service Manager, ensure that the Web app is successfully deployed and hybrid connection is created. To verify the connection is successfully established with the on-prem Service Manager machine, visit the  Web app URL as detailed in the documentation for making the [hybrid connection](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#configure-the-hybrid-connection).

2.	If data from ServiceNow is not getting synced in OMS, ensure that the ServiceNow instance is not sleeping. This might sometime happen in the ServiceNow Dev instances, when idle. Else, report the issue.
3.	If Alerts are getting fired from OMS but work items are not getting created in ITSM product or configuration items are not getting created/linked to work items or for any generic information, do the following:
 -  IT Service Management Connector solution in OMS portal could be used to get a summary of connections/work items/computers etc. Click the error message in the status blade, navigate to **Log Search** and view the connection that has the error by using the details in the error message.
 - you can directly view the errors/related information in the **Log Search** page using *Type=ServiceDeskLog_CL*.

## Troubleshoot Service Manager Web App deployment
1.	In case of any trouble with web app deployment, ensure you have sufficient permissions in the subscription mentioned to create/deploy resources.
2.	If **Object reference not set to instance of an object** error message appears while running the [script](log-analytics-itsmc-service-manager-script.md) ensure that you entered valid values  under **User Configuration** section.
3.	If you fail to create service bus relay namespace, ensure that the required resource provider is registered in the subscription. If not registered, manually create it from the Azure portal. You can also create it while [creating the hybrid connection](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#configure-the-hybrid-connection) from the Azure portal.
