# Change the credit card used to pay for an Azure subscription
You can add, change, or remove a credit card that’s associated with your Azure account when you sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the [account administrator](billing-subscription-transfer.md#whoisaa).

## Add a credit card as a payment method

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Select the subscription.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. Select “+” to add a credit card.
5. Choose a credit card type and enter the required information.
6. Select **Next**. 

If the card is valid, it's added to the list of available payment methods.

If you get an error after you add the credit card, see [Credit card declined at Azure sign-up](billing-credit-card-fails-during-azure-sign-up.md).

## Edit payment information for an existing credit card
  If your credit card gets renewed and the number remains the same, update the existing credit card details like the expiration date. If your credit card number changes because the card is lost, stolen, or expired, follow the steps in the [Add a credit card as a payment method](#addcard) section. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Select the subscription that's linked to the credit card.</br> ![Screenshot that shows an example subscription selected.](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/selectsub.png)

## Change the credit card that pays your Azure bill

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Select the subscription.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. Click **Use Instead** and select the credit card that you want to use.

## Remove a credit card from the account
1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator.
2. Select the subscription.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. Click **Delete** for the credit card that you want to delete.

If your credit card is associated with other active Microsoft subscriptions, you can't remove it from your Azure account. Remove the credit card from all active subscriptions that you have with Microsoft.

##  How to make payments

* If you set up a credit card or a debit card as your payment method, the payment is made automatically.
* If you use [an invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/), send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice.
