# Upgrade your Free Trial or Microsoft Imagine Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go
Upgrade your [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or [Microsoft Imagine](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/) subscription to [Pay-As-You-Go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) from the Azure Account Portal. Upgrading does not cost any money by itself, and you will only be charged for the services you use.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) and navigate to the **subscriptions** tab.
2. In the subscription status section, select the **Upgrade now** banner.
