# Your debit card or credit card is declined at Azure sign-up
If your debit card or credit card is declined or not accepted when you sign up for Azure, you might be facing one of the following issues:

* **The credit card or debit card provider is not accepted for your country.** When you choose a card, you only see the options that are valid in the country that you select. Contact your bank or card issuer to confirm that your credit card is enabled for international transactions. See supported countries and currencies in [Azure Purchase FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/faq/).
* **Your credit or debit card information is inaccurate or incomplete.** The name, address, and CVV code you enter must match exactly what’s printed on the card.
* **You're using a virtual or prepaid card.** Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards aren't accepted as payment for Azure subscriptions.
* **The card is inactive or blocked.** Contact your bank to ensure your card is active.
* **You may be experiencing other sign-up issues** Check out how to [troubleshoot Azure sign-up](billing-troubleshoot-azure-sign-up-issues.md).

After you update your payment information, try signing up again.

## Representing a business that doesn't want to pay by card? Set up invoicing
If you represent a business, you can pay for your Azure subscription with invoice payment methods like checks, overnight checks, or wire transfers. You can’t change to another payment option after you’re set up to pay by invoice. To pay by invoice, see [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).

## Update your credit card or debit card information
After you sign up, [manage your payment information](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md) to change or remove a card.

## Need more help? Contact support.
