# How to install and configure SAP HANA (large instances) on Azure

The installation of SAP HANA is your responsibility and you can start the activity after handoff of a new SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) server and after the connectivity between your Azure VNet(s) and the HANA Large Instance unit(s) got established. Please note, per SAP policy, installation of SAP HANA must be performed by a person certified to perform SAP HANA installations— someone who has passed the Certified SAP Technology Associate – SAP HANA Installation certification exam, or by a SAP-certified system integrator (SI).

Check again, especially when planning to install HANA 2.0, [SAP Support Note #2235581 - SAP HANA: Supported Operating Systems](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2235581/E) in order to make sure that the OS is supported with the SAP HANA release you decided to install. You will realize that the supported OS for HANA 2.0 is more restricted than the OS supported for HANA 1.0. 

## First steps after receiving the HANA Large Instance Unit(s)

**First Step** after receiving the HANA Large Instance and having established access and connectivity to the instances is to register the OS of the instance with your OS provider. This would include registering your SUSE Linux OS in an instance of SUSE SMT that you need to have deployed in a VM in Azure that the HANA Large Instance unit can connect to. Or your RedHat OS needs to be registered with the Red Hat Subscription Manager you need to connect to. See also remarks in this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sap-hana-overview-architecture?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json). This step also is necessary to be able to patch the OS going forward. A task that is in the responsibility of the customer. For SUSE, find documentation to install and configure SMT [here](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/book_smt/data/smt_installation.html).

**Second Step** is to check for new patches and fixes of the specific OS release/version. Check whether the patch level of the HANA Large Instance is on the latest state. Based on timing on OS patch/releases and changes to the image Microsoft can deploy there might be cases where the latest patches may not be included. Hence it is a mandatory step after taking over a HANA Large Instance unit and having the OS installation registered with the Linux distributor, to check whether patches relevant for security, functionality, availability and performance were released meanwhile by the particular Linux vendor and need to be applied.

**Third Step** is to check out the relevant SAP Notes for installing and configuring SAP HANA on the specific OS release/version. Due to changing recommendations or changes to SAP Notes or configurations that are dependent on individual installation scenarios, Microsoft will not always be able to have a HANA Large Instance unit configured perfectly. Hence it is mandatory for you as a customer, to read the SAP Notes (minimum listed below), check the configurations of the OS release/version necessary apply the configuration settings where not done already.

In specific, please check the following parameters and eventually adjusted to:

- net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
- net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
- net.core.rmem_default = 16777216
- net.core.wmem_default = 16777216
- net.core.optmem_max = 16777216
- net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 65536 16777216 16777216
- net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 65536 16777216 16777216

Starting with SLES12 SP1 and RHEL 7.2, these parameters must be set in a configuration file in the /etc/sysctl.d directory. For example, a configuration file with the name 91-NetApp-HANA.conf must be created. For older SLES and RHEL releases, these parameters must be set in/etc/sysctl.conf.

For all RHEL releases and starting with SLES12, the 
- sunrpc.tcp_slot_table_entries = 128

parameter must be set in/etc/modprobe.d/sunrpc-local.conf. If the file does not exist, it must first be created by adding the following entry: 
- options sunrpc tcp_max_slot_table_entries=128

**Fourth Step** is to check the system time of your HANA Large Instance Unit. 
The instances will be deployed with a system time zone that represent the location of the Azure region the HANA Large Instance Stamp is located in. You are free to change the system time or time zone of the instances you own. Doing so and ordering more instances into your tenant, be prepared that you need to adapt the time zone of the newly delivered instances. Microsoft operations have no insights into the system time zone you set up with the instances after the handover. Hence newly deployed instances might not be set in the same time zone as the one you changed to. As a result, it is your responsibility as customer to check and if necessary adapt the time zone of the instance(s) handed over. 

**Fifth Step** is to check etc/hosts. As the blades get handed over, they have different IP addresses assigned for different purposes (see next section). Please check etc/hosts. In cases where units are added into an existing tenant, don't expect to have etc/hosts of the newly deployed systems maintained correctly with the IP addresses of earlier delivered systems. Hence it is on you as customer to check the correct settings so, that a newly deployed instance can interact and resolve the names of earlier deployed units in your tenant. 

## Networking
We assume that you followed the recommendations in designing your Azure VNets and connecting those to the HANA Large Instances as described in these documents:

- [SAP HANA (large Instance) Overview and Architecture on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture)
- [SAP HANA (large instances) Infrastructure and connectivity on Azure](hana-overview-infrastructure-connectivity.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json)

There are some details worth to mention about the networking of the single units. Every HANA Large Instance unit comes with two or three IP addresses that are assigned to two or three NIC ports of the unit. Three IP addresses are used in HANA scale-out configurations and the HANA System Replication scenario. One of the IP addresses assigned to the NIC of the unit is out of the Server IP pool that was described in the [SAP HANA (large Instance) Overview and Architecture on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-overview-architecture).

The distribution for units with two IP addresses assigned should look like:

- eth0.xx should have an IP address assigned that is out of the Server IP Pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. This IP address shall be used for maintaining in /etc/hosts of the OS.
- eth1.xx should have an IP address assigned that is used for communication to NFS. Therefore, these addresses do **NOT** need to be maintained in etc/hosts in order to allow instance to instance traffic within the tenant.

For deployment cases of HANA System Replication or HANA scale-out a blade configuration with two IP addresses assigned is not suitable. In case of having two IP addresses assigned only and wanting to deploy such a configuration, please contact Microsoft Service Management to get a third IP address in a 3rd VLAN assigned. For HANA Large Instance units having three IP addresses assigned on three NIC ports, the following applies:

- eth0.xx should have an IP address assigned that is out of the Server IP Pool address range that you submitted to Microsoft. Hence this IP address shall not be used for maintaining in /etc/hosts of the OS.
- eth1.xx should have an IP address assigned that is used for communication to NFS storage. Hence this type of addresses should not be maintained in etc/hosts.
- eth2.xx should be exclusively used to be maintained in etc/hosts for communication between the different instances. These would also be the IP addresses that need to be maintained in scale-out HANA configurations as IP addresses HANA uses for the inter-node configuration.



## Storage

The storage layout for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) is configured by SAP HANA on Azure Service Management through SAP recommended best practices, see the [SAP HANA Storage Requirements](http://go.sap.com/documents/2015/03/74cdb554-5a7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) white paper. As you read the paper and look a HANA Large Instance unit, you will realize that the units come with rather generous disk volume for HANA/data and that we have a volume HANA/log/backup. The reason why we sized the HANA/data is so large is that the storage snapshots we offer for you as a customer are using the very same disk volume. This means the more storage snapshots you perform, the more space for those is needed. The HANA/log/backup volume is not thought to be the volume to put database backups in, but to leverage this as backup volume for the HANA transaction log. In future versions of the storage snapshot self service we will target this specific volume to have more frequent snapshots and with that more frequent replications to the disaster recovery site if you desire to option-in for the disaster recovery functionality provided by the HANA Large Instance infrastructure.See details in [SAP HANA (large instances) High Availability and Disaster Recovery on Azure](hana-overview-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) 

In addition to the storage provided, you can purchase additional storage capacity in 1 TB increments. This additional storage can be added as new volumes to a HANA Large Instances.

During onboarding with Microsoft Service Management, the customer specifies a User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) for the <SID>ADM user and sapsys group (ex: 1000,500) It is necessary that during installation of the SAP HANA system, these same values are used.

The storage controller and nodes in the Large Instance stamps are synchronized to NTP servers. With you synchronizing the SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) units and Azure VMs against an NTP server, there should be no significant time drift happening between the infrastructure and the compute units in Azure or Large Instance stamps.

In order to optimize SAP HANA to the storage used underneath, you should also set the following SAP HANA configuration parameters:

- max_parallel_io_requests 128
- async_read_submit on
- async_write_submit_active on
- async_write_submit_blocks all
 
For SAP HANA 1.0 versions up to SPS12, these parameters can be set during the installation of the SAP HANA database, as described in [SAP Note #2267798 - Configuration of the SAP HANA Database](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2267798)

You also can configure the parameters after the SAP HANA database installation by using the hdbparam framework. 

With SAP HANA 2.0, the hdbparam framework has been deprecated. As a result the parameters must be set using SQL commands. For details, see [SAP Note #2399079: Elimination of hdbparam in HANA 2](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2399079).


## Operating system

Swap space of the delivered OS image is set to 2GB according to the [SAP Support Note #1999997 - FAQ: SAP HANA Memory](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1999997/E). Any different setting desired needs to be set by you as a customer.

[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 for SAP Applications](https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/hana) is the distribution of Linux installed for SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances). This particular distribution provides SAP-specific capabilities &quot;out of the box&quot; (including pre-set parameters for running SAP on SLES effectively).

## Time synchronization

SAP is very sensitive on time differences for the various components that comprise the SAP system. SAP ABAP short dumps with the error title of ZDATE\_LARGE\_TIME\_DIFF are likely familiar if you have been working with SAP (Basis) for a long time, as these short dumps appear when the system time of different servers or VMs is drifting too far apart.

For SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances), time synchronization done in Azure doesn&#39;t apply to the compute units in the Large Instance stamps. This is not applicable for running SAP applications natively in Azure (on VMs), as Azure ensures a system&#39;s time is properly synchronized. As a result, a separate time server must be set up that can be used by SAP application servers running on Azure VMs and the SAP HANA database instances running on HANA Large Instances. The storage infrastructure in Large Instance stamps is time synchronized with NTP servers.
