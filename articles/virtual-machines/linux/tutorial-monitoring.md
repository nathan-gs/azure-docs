# How to monitor a Linux virtual machine in Azure

To ensure your virtual machines (VMs) in Azure are running correctly, you can review boot diagnostics and performance metrics. In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable boot diagnostics on the VM
> * View boot diagnostics
> * View host metrics
> * Enable diagnostics extension on the VM
> * View VM metrics
> * Create alerts based on diagnostic metrics
> * Set up advanced monitoring


[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create VM

To see diagnostics and metrics in action, you need a VM. First, create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/gropu#create). The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroupMonitor* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroupMonitor --location eastus
```

Now create a VM with [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create). The following example creates a VM named *myVM*:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor \
  --name myVM \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Enable boot diagnostics

As Linux VMs boot, the boot diagnostic extension captures boot output and stores it in Azure storage. This data can be used to troubleshoot VM boot issues. Boot diagnostics are not automatically enabled when you create a Linux VM using the Azure CLI.

Before enabling boot diagnostics, a storage account needs to be created for storing boot logs. Storage accounts must have a globally unique name, be between 3 and 24 characters, and must contain only numbers and lowercase letters. Create a storage account with the [az storage account create](/cli/azure/storage/account#create) command. In this example, a random string is used to create a unique storage account name. 

```azurecli-interactive 
storageacct=mydiagdata$RANDOM

az storage account create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor \
  --name $storageacct \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --location eastus
```

When enabling boot diagnostics, the URI to the blob storage container is needed. The following command queries the storage account to return this URI. The URI value is stored in a variable names *bloburi*, which is used in the next step.

```azurecli-interactive 
bloburi=$(az storage account show --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor --name $storageacct --query 'primaryEndpoints.blob' -o tsv)
```

Now enable boot diagnostics with [az vm boot-diagnostics enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/boot-diagnostics#enable). The `--storage` value is the blob URI collected in the previous step.

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm boot-diagnostics enable \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor \
  --name myVM \
  --storage $bloburi
```


## View boot diagnostics

When boot diagnostics are enabled, each time you stop and start the VM, information about the boot process is written to a log file. For this example, first deallocate the VM with the [az vm deallocate](/cli/azure/vm#deallocate) command as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor --name myVM
```

Now start the VM with the [az vm start]( /cli/azure/vm#stop) command as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm start --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor --name myVM
```

You can get the boot diagnostic data for *myVM* with the [az vm boot-diagnostics get-boot-log](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/boot-diagnostics#get-boot-log) command as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm boot-diagnostics get-boot-log --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor --name myVM
```


## View host metrics

A Linux VM has a dedicated host in Azure that it interacts with. Metrics are automatically collected for the host and can be viewed in the Azure portal as follows:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Resource Groups**, select **myResourceGroupMonitor**, and then select **myVM** in the resource list.
1. To see how the host VM is performing, click **Metrics** on the VM blade, then select any of the *[Host]* metrics under **Available metrics**.

## Install diagnostics extension

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This document describes version 2.3 of the Linux Diagnostic Extension, which has been deprecated. Version 2.3 will be supported until June 30, 2018.
>
> Version 3.0 of the Linux Diagnostic Extension can be enabled instead. For more information, see [the documentation](./diagnostic-extension.md).

The basic host metrics are available, but to see more granular and VM-specific metrics, you to need to install the Azure diagnostics extension on the VM. The Azure diagnostics extension allows additional monitoring and diagnostics data to be retrieved from the VM. You can view these performance metrics and create alerts based on how the VM performs. The diagnostic extension is installed through the Azure portal as follows:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Resource Groups**, select **myResourceGroup**, and then select **myVM** in the resource list.
1. Click **Diagnosis settings**. The list shows that *Boot diagnostics* are already enabled from the previous section. Click the check box for *Basic metrics*.
1. In the *Storage account* section, browse to and select the *mydiagdata[1234]* account created in the previous section.
1. Click the **Save** button.

    ![View diagnostic metrics](./media/tutorial-monitoring/enable-diagnostics-extension.png)


## View VM metrics

You can view the VM metrics in the same way that you viewed the host VM metrics:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Resource Groups**, select **myResourceGroup**, and then select **myVM** in the resource list.
1. To see how the VM is performing, click **Metrics** on the VM blade, and then select any of the diagnostics metrics under **Available metrics**.

    ![View VM metrics](./media/tutorial-monitoring/monitor-vm-metrics.png)


## Create alerts

You can create alerts based on specific performance metrics. Alerts can be used to notify you when average CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold or available free disk space drops below a certain amount, for example. Alerts are displayed in the Azure portal or can be sent via email. You can also trigger Azure Automation runbooks or Azure Logic Apps in response to alerts being generated.

The following example creates an alert for average CPU usage.

1. In the Azure portal, click **Resource Groups**, select **myResourceGroup**, and then select **myVM** in the resource list.
2. Click **Alert rules** on the VM blade, then click **Add metric alert** across the top of the alerts blade.
4. Provide a **Name** for your alert, such as *myAlertRule*
5. To trigger an alert when CPU percentage exceeds 1.0 for five minutes, leave all the other defaults selected.
6. Optionally, check the box for *Email owners, contributors, and readers* to send email notification. The default action is to present a notification in the portal.
7. Click the **OK** button.


## Advanced monitoring 

You can do more advanced monitoring of your VM by using [Operations Management Suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-overview). If you haven't already done so, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite-trial) of Operations Management Suite.

When you have access to the OMS portal, you can find the workspace key and workspace identifier on the Settings blade. Replace <workspace-key> and <workspace-id> with the values for from your OMS workspace and then you can use **az vm extension set** to add the OMS extension to the VM:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm extension set \
  --resource-group myResourceGroupMonitor \
  --vm-name myVM \
  --name OmsAgentForLinux \
  --publisher Microsoft.EnterpriseCloud.Monitoring \
  --version 1.3 \
  --protected-settings '{"workspaceKey": "<workspace-key>"}' \
  --settings '{"workspaceId": "<workspace-id>"}'
```

On the Log Search blade of the OMS portal, you should see *myVM* such as what is shown in the following picture:

![OMS blade](./media/tutorial-monitoring/tutorial-monitor-oms.png)
