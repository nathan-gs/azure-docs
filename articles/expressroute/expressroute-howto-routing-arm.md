This article walks you through the steps to create and manage routing configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit using PowerShell and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.  The steps below also show you how to check the status, update, or delete and deprovision peerings for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

## Configuration prerequisites

* You will need the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview). 
* Make sure that you have reviewed the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) page, the [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md) page, and the [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) page before you begin configuration.
* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit. Follow the instructions to [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider before you proceed. The ExpressRoute circuit must be in a provisioned and enabled state for you to be able to run the cmdlets described below.

These instructions only apply to circuits created with service providers offering Layer 2 connectivity services. If you are using a service provider offering managed Layer 3 services (typically an IPVPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider will configure and manage routing for you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We currently do not advertise peerings configured by service providers through the service management portal. We are working on enabling this capability soon. Please check with your service provider before configuring BGP peerings.
> 
> 

You can configure one, two, or all three peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft) for an ExpressRoute circuit. You can configure peerings in any order you choose. However, you must make sure that you complete the configuration of each peering one at a time. 

## Azure private peering

This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Azure private peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

### To create Azure private peering

1. Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.

  You must install the latest PowerShell installer from [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and import the Azure Resource Manager modules into the PowerShell session in order to start using the ExpressRoute cmdlets. You will need to run PowerShell as an Administrator.

  ```powershell
  Install-Module AzureRM
  Install-AzureRM
  ```

  Import all of the AzureRM.* modules within the known semantic version range.

  ```powershell
  Import-AzureRM
  ```

  You can also just import a select module within the known semantic version range.

  ```powershell
  Import-Module AzureRM.Network 
  ```

  Sign in to your account.

  ```powershell
  Login-AzureRmAccount
  ```

  Select the subscription you want to create ExpressRoute circuit.

  ```powershell
  Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscription ID>"
  ```
2. Create an ExpressRoute circuit.

  Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider.

  If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure private peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below. 
3. Check the ExpressRoute circuit to ensure it is provisioned.

  You must first check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled. See the following example:

  ```powershell
  Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"
  ```

  The response will be something similar to the following example:

  ```
  Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
  ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
  Location                         : westus
  Id                               : /subscriptions/***************************/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit
  Etag                             : W/"################################"
  ProvisioningState                : Succeeded
  Sku                              : {
                                       "Name": "Standard_MeteredData",
                                       "Tier": "Standard",
                                       "Family": "MeteredData"
                                     }
  CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled
  ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
  ServiceProviderNotes             : 
  ServiceProviderProperties        : {
                                       "ServiceProviderName": "Equinix",
                                       "PeeringLocation": "Silicon Valley",
                                       "BandwidthInMbps": 200
                                     }
  ServiceKey                       : **************************************
  Peerings                         : []
  ```
4. Configure Azure private peering for the circuit.

  Make sure that you have the following items before you proceed with the next steps:

  * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
  * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
  * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Ensure that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
  * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers. You can use a private AS number for this peering. Ensure that you are not using 65515.
  * An MD5 hash if you choose to use one. **This is optional**.

  You can run the following cmdlet to configure Azure private peering for your circuit:

  ```powershell
  Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200

  Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
  ```

  You can use the following cmdlet if you choose to use an MD5 hash:

  ```powershell
  Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200  -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Ensure that you specify your AS number as peering ASN, not customer ASN.
  > 
  >

### To view Azure private peering details

You can get configuration details using the following cmdlet:

```powershell
$ckt = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt
```

### To update Azure private peering configuration

You can update any part of the configuration using the following cmdlet. In the following example, the VLAN ID of the circuit is being updated from 100 to 500:

```powershell
Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200

Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
```

### To delete Azure private peering

You can remove your peering configuration by running the following cmdlet:

> [!WARNING]
> You must ensure that all virtual networks are unlinked from the ExpressRoute circuit before running this cmdlet. 
> 
> 

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt

Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
```
