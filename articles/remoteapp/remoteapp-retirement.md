# Azure RemoteApp Retirement
You have been directed to this article because we have not been able to contact you to acknowledge the retirement of Azure RemoteApp. 

We have been trying to contact you and the other Azure subscription administrators in order to verify that you are aware that Azure RemoteApp is being retired on August 31st 2017, we [announced the retirement of Azure RemoteApp on August 12th, 2016](http://aka.ms/araretirement).   We urgently request you reply to [arainfo@microsoft.com](mailto:arainfo@microsoft.com) indicating:
1.	You and your organization acknowledge the retirement on August 31st 2017
2.	Tell us about your migration plans â€“ we can help if needed. Migration options are detailed in [Options for migrating out of Azure RemoteApp](http://aka.ms/aramigration), such as Citrix XenApp Essentials, MyCloudIT, Frame, etc. 

The REMOTEAPP node within the Azure management portal might have been blocked, we did this because we could not contact you and had to force your engagement with us.  You may not have received our emails because the email address associated with the Azure subscription are not being monitored or are not valid.  We strongly encourage you to validate the emails address associated with your Azure subscription are valid and monitored, you can do this by navigating to the Azure portal and verifying the subscription Administrators.  

Still have questions or need migration support?  Email us at [arainfo@microsoft.com](mailto:arainfo@microsoft.com) or [book a meeting](http://aka.ms/ericorman) with our transition team now.
