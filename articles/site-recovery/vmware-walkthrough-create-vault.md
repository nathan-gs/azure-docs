# Step 7: Set up a vault for VMware replication to Azure


This article describes how to set up a vault, and specify what you want to replicate from your on-premises location, to Azure using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service in the Azure portal.


Post comments and questions at the bottom of this article, or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).




## Create a Recovery Services vault

1. Click **Recovery Services vaults** > vault.
2. In the Resource Menu, click **Site Recovery** > **Prepare Infrastructure** > **Protection goal**.
