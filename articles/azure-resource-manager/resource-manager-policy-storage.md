# Apply resource policies to storage accounts
This topic shows several [resource policies](resource-manager-policy.md) you can apply to Azure storage accounts. These policies ensure consistency for the storage accounts deployed in your organization. 

## Define permitted storage account types

The following policy restricts which [storage account types](../storage/storage-redundancy.md) can be deployed:

```json
{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
      },
      {
        "not": {
          "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/sku.name",
          "in": [
            "Standard_LRS",
            "Standard_GRS"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

A similar policy rule with a parameter for accepting the allowed SKUs is available as a built-in policy definition. The built-in policy has the resource ID of `/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/7433c107-6db4-4ad1-b57a-a76dce0154a1`. 

## Define permitted access tier

The following policy specifies the type of [access tier](../storage/storage-blob-storage-tiers.md) that can be specified for storage accounts:

```json
{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
      },
      {
        "field": "kind",
        "equals": "BlobStorage"
      },
      {
        "not": {
          "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/accessTier",
          "equals": "cool"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

## Ensure encryption is enabled

The following policy requires all storage accounts to enable [Storage service encryption](../storage/storage-service-encryption.md):

```json
{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
      },
      {
        "not": {
          "field": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/enableBlobEncryption",
          "equals": "true"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

This policy rule is also available as a built-in policy definition with the resource ID of `/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/7c5a74bf-ae94-4a74-8fcf-644d1e0e6e6f`.

## Next steps
* After defining a policy rule (as shown in the preceding examples), you need to create the policy definition and assign it to a scope. The scope can be a subscription, resource group, or resource. To assign policies through the portal, see [Use Azure portal to assign and manage resource policies](resource-manager-policy-portal.md). To assign policies through REST API, PowerShell or Azure CLI, see [Assign and manage policies through script](resource-manager-policy-create-assign.md). 
* For guidance on how enterprises can use Resource Manager to effectively manage subscriptions, see [Azure enterprise scaffold - prescriptive subscription governance](resource-manager-subscription-governance.md).
