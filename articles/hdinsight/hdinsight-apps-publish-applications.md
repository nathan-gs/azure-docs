# Publish HDInsight applications into the Azure Marketplace
An HDInsight application is an application that users can install on a Linux-based HDInsight cluster. These applications can be developed by Microsoft, independent software vendors (ISV) or by yourself. In this article, you learn how to publish an HDInsight application into the Azure Marketplace.  For general information about publishing into the Azure Marketplace, see [publish an offer to the Azure Marketplace](../marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-getting-started.md).

HDInsight applications use the *Bring Your Own License (BYOL)* model, where application provider is responsible for licensing the application to end-users, and end-users are only charged by Azure for the resources they create, such as the HDInsight cluster and its VMs/nodes. Currently, billing for the application itself is not done through Azure.

* [Install custom HDInsight applications](hdinsight-apps-install-custom-applications.md): Learn how to install and test custom HDInsight applications.

## Prerequisites
To submit your custom application to the marketplace, you must have created and tested your custom application. See the following articles:

* [Install custom HDInsight applications](hdinsight-apps-install-custom-applications.md): Learn how to install and test custom HDInsight applications.

You must also have registered your developer account. See [publish an offer to the Azure Marketplace](../marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-getting-started.md) and [Create a Microsoft Developer account](../marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md).

## Define application
There are two steps involved for publishing applications to the Azure Marketplace.  First you define a **createUiDef.json** file to indicate which clusters your application is compatible with; and then you publish the template from the Azure portal. The following section is a sample createUiDef.json file.

    {
        "handler": "Microsoft.HDInsight",
        "version": "0.0.1-preview",
        "clusterFilters": {
            "types": ["Hadoop", "HBase", "Storm", "Spark"],
            "tiers": ["Standard", "Premium"],
            "versions": ["3.4"]
        }
    }


| Field | Description | Possible values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| types |The cluster types that the application is compatible with. |Hadoop, HBase, Storm, Spark, (or any combination of these) |
| tiers |The cluster tiers that the application is compatible with. |Standard, Premium, (or both) |
| versions |The HDInsight cluster types that the application is compatible with. |3.4 |

## Application install script
Whenever an application is installed on a cluster (either an existing one or a new one), an edge node is created and the application install script is run on it.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The name of the application install script names must be unique for a particular cluster with the following format.
  > 
  > name": "[concat('hue-install-v0','-' ,uniquestring(‘applicationName’)]"
  > 
  > Note there are three parts to the script name:
  > 
  > 1. A script name prefix, which shall include either the application name or a name relevant to the application.
  > 2. A "-" for readability.
  > 3. A unique string function with the application name as the parameter.
  > 
  > An example is the above ends up becoming: hue-install-v0-4wkahss55hlas in the persisted script action list. For a sample JSON payload, see [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdinsight/Iaas-Applications/master/Hue/azuredeploy.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdinsight/Iaas-Applications/master/Hue/azuredeploy.json).
  > 
The installation script must have the following characteristics:
1. Ensure that the script is idempotent. Multiple calls to the script should produce the same result.
2. The script should be properly versioned. Use a different location for the script when you are upgrading or testing out changes so that customers that are trying to install the application are not affected. 
3. Add adequate logging to the scripts at each point. Usually the script logs are the only way to debug application installation issues.
4. Ensure that calls to external services or resources have adequate retries so that the installation is not affected by transient network issues.
5. If your script is starting services on the nodes, ensure that the services are monitored and configured to start automatically in case of node reboots.

## Package application
Create a zip file that contains all required files for installing your HDInsight applications. You need the zip file in [Publish application](#publish-application).

* [createUiDefinition.json](#define-application).
* mainTemplate.json. See a sample at [Install custom HDInsight applications](hdinsight-apps-install-custom-applications.md).
* All required scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> The application files (including web application files if there is any) can be located on any publicly accessible endpoint.
> 

## Publish application
Follow the following steps to publish an HDInsight application:

1. Sign on to the [Azure Publishing portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com/).
2. Click **Solution templates** from the left to create a new solution template.
3. Enter a title, and then click **Create a new solution template**.
4. Click **Create Dev Center account and join the Azure program** to register your company if you haven't done so.  See [Create a Microsoft Developer account](../marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md).
5. Click **Define some Topologies to get Started**. A solution template is a "parent" to all its topologies. You can define multiple topologies in one offer/solution template. When an offer is pushed to staging, it is pushed with all its topologies. 
6. Enter a topology name, and then click the plus sign.
7. Enter a new version, and then click the Plus sign.
8. Upload the zip file prepared in [Package application](#package-application).  
9. Click **Request Certification**. The Microsoft certification team will review the files and certify the topology.
